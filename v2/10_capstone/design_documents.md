# Objective
Brief description of what are the goals of this project.

# Background
Describe one needs to know to understand the context for this project.

# Overview
One-page high level overview describe what’s to be done in this project.

# Detail Design/Ideas
Detail write ups on design approaches, ideas/experiment planned, requirements, timeline/schedule, etc.

Tips:
* Focus on design, not implementation
* A picture is worth a thousand words.  A diagram or drawing of the data and model at times is much easier to understand than words
* If describing alternatives, eg: approach, platform, algorithm - explain why it’s not part of the design
* Do go back and update it during implementation you took a different approach that originally designed

# Fairness Considerations
Fill out an [ethical storyboarding worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DyWrmHpebD9WsROXK3ncC2GTfz90AgMYutkpfDeKwLY/edit) as part of your detail design

The ethical storyboarding worksheet asks your group to:
* descrbe a fictional person who was positively affected by a model trained with this data
* describe a fictional person who was negatively affected by a model trained with this data
* describe at least two sources of bias the particular model in your story could have
* describe at least one way you could modify the model to mitigate this bias
  * what can you do when designing our model to account for inherent bias in its input data?
* describe at least one way you could modify the dataset to mitigate this bias 
  * what could you do differently if you collected this data again? 
* describe at least one way you could modify the context surrounding the model to mitigate this bias
  * consider what human practices or policies you could put in place to protect people within the social system where this model is used
