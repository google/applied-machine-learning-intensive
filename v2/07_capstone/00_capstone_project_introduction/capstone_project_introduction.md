# Capstone Project Introduction

<!--
Today we'll begin discussing the culminating assignment for this course: the capstone project. We'll begin by going over the project goals, guidelines, deliverables, and timeline in this presentation. Please feel free to ask questions as we go through. Later on we'll move into discussing project topic ideation and begin the process of forming teams. 
-->

---

# Project Goals

* Apply technical ML concepts and data skills learned in the first half of the course on a sizeable dataset and challenging problem
* Demonstrate professional development skills, such as working in a group with different personalities, giving and receiving feedback, communicating results, and project management
* Create and facilitate a recorded demo or presentation of capstone project work

<!--
A significant amount of this course and class time are intentionally devoted to the capstone project.

We do this because employers want to see and hear about times you have worked collaboratively with other people in pursuit of a shared goal. Truthfully, that's much of professional life. You are better equipped to make your case to employers that you have experience working with others toward a technical goal if you have specific projects you can speak to, both listed on your resume and in your interview answers. The capstone project is one of those experiences, and it also allows you to apply the skills you've learned so far to create a specific project and present it.

# Capstone Project Deliverables

## Deliverables 1-2 of 4

**1.) Design doc - 20%**
* Goal(s) for the project - ideally long term, and realistic for the project duration
* Who will play what roles (program manager, note taker) during each project phase
* Describe the dataset(s), data acquisition, and data preparation
* Explain problem space and motivated questions
* Approach and list of tasks

**2.) Ethical storyboarding worksheet - 10%**

<!--
First your team will complete a design doc that lays out the goals for your team's unique project, which team members will play what roles during each of the project phases, data-related information, what problem your project seeks to solve, and a list of tasks you'll complete in pursuit of that solution. A design doc template will be provided.

Next you'll complete an ethical storyboarding worksheet that facilitates thought and discussion about the ethical implications of your project idea. Again, a template will be provided. 
-->

# Capstone Project Deliverables

## Deliverables 3-4 of 4

**3.) Notebook - 50%**
* The notebook should read like a formal report and follow a linear flow from start to finish with both narrative and code blocks. 
* The notebook should be internally complete in the sense that a “reader” should understand the motivating question, goals, dataset, model, and ethical considerations. 
* Markdown cells with narrative should precede and follow each code block.
* For each piece of code, describe the purpose, an overview of how it works, and how to interpret results.
* Discuss current limitations and future improvements (if applicable).

**4.) Project demo or presentation - 20%**
* Overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve (if applicable)
* Conclusions and findings
* Things that went well, things that did not go well, and lessons learned
* Next steps (if applicable)

<!--
In addition to the design doc and ethical storyboarding exercise, your team will submit a notebook of your project's narrative and code blocks that reads like a formal report. For each piece of code, you should describe the purpose, an overview of how it works, and how to interpret the results. If applicable, include a discussion of current limitations and future improvements.

Last is the project demo or presentation. We'll get into the specific requirements for the project presentation later on in this discussion.

* [Boston housing price regression dataset](https://keras.io/datasets/#boston-housing-price-regression-dataset) Dataset taken from the StatLib library, which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. Samples contain 13 attributes of houses at different locations around the Boston suburbs in the late 1970s.
* [NOAA GSOD dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/noaa/gsod) Daily global surface summary from over 9000 weather stations from 1929 to 2016 maintained by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
* [UC Irvine ML Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html) A collection of datasets including Life Sciences, Physical Sciences, Business, CS/Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.
* [Google BigQuery Public dataset](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/) Readily available copies of public datasets including Github actions, US births, Shakespeare, Wikipedia revision history, etc.
* [Google AI Datasets](https://ai.google/tools/datasets/) A collection of datasets with wide-ranging topics.
* [dataCommons](https://browser.datacommons.org/) Constructed by synthesizing a single Knowledge Graph from many different data sources. It currently contains data from Wikipedia, the US Census, NOAA, FBI, etc.

Alternatively, you can use [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) or [Google Public Data Explorer](https://www.google.com/publicdata/directory) to search for an interesting dataset for your project.

<!--
Linked here are some datasets your team can consider using for your project. Alternatively, Kaggle and Google Public Data Explorer have datasets to look through, too.

# Project Timeline

## Phases 1-2 of 4

**Project Phase 1**
* Form teams
* Explore and pick project topics
* Write a design doc on how you approach building the ML model
* Create a high level project plan of who’s doing what tasks by when

**Project Phase 2**
* Acquire & prep dataset
* Start defining and training your ML model
* Beginning project presentation: discuss acquiring data, exploratory data analysis, and justification for first model

<!--
There are four distinct phases of the capstone project. The first involves forming teams, exploring and picking project topics, and completing the design doc and project plan to guide your work. Please note a template will NOT be provided for the project plan. The project plan format will be up to your team to decide. You're welcome to use one we worked on the project management session or create a new one.

The second project phase includes acquiring and prepping your team's dataset, defining and training your ML model, and beginning designing your project presentation or demo.
--> 

---

# Project Timeline

## Phases 3-4 of 4

**Project Phase 3**
* Use data to tune model and validate
* Mid project presentation: share iterations of model tuning with a focus on challenges and questions, welcome feedback from peers and instructors
* Group and individual meetings with the instructional team

**Project Phase 4**
* Final iterations on model predictions
* Review results and prepare conclusions
* Practice final presentation and demo, collect, and incorporate final feedback

<!--
The third project phase involves using data to tune and validate your model and continuing to work on your final presentation with peer and instructor feedback.

The fourth phase includes final iterations on model predictions, reviewing results and preparing conclusions. And then, finally, you'll present your final presentations to the class. Now we'll transition into the expectations for your final presentations.
--> 

---

# Final Presentations

* Project demo or presentation should adhere to the following format and cover all the points here:
 * Overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve, if applicable
 * Conclusions and findings
 * Things that went well, things that did not go well, and lessons learned
 * Next steps, if applicable
* Presentations should be 15 minutes each plus five minutes for questions. Each member of the team should present for roughly the same amount of time. 
* Presentations should be visually interesting but also follow best practices for verbal presentation skills. Namely, it is important for all points to be conveyed clearly. 
* You will have an opportunity to present to the instructional team during the 2-3 days leading up to final presentations. It's recommended that you incorporate their feedback.

<!--
Final presentations should include an overview of the project and the problem it seeks to solve, conclusions and findings, lessons learned, and a brief discussion of what went well and what didn't go well. It should include any next steps your team has as you consider future developments for your project.

Each team's presentation should last 15 minutes, and there will be an additional five minutes allowed for Q&A. Every team member is expected to present for roughly the same amount of time. Please consider presentation best practices and make a presentation that is visually interesting and one that conveys your points clearly. 

You will have opportunities to practice your presentation for instructional staff, and we recommend taking advantage of those opportunities to refine your team's presentation.

# Capstone Project Team Roles

Rotating with each of the four project phases, team members will take turns working in different capacities.

**Program Manager:** Everyone will have a turn in the role of “program manager,” or the person who is purposefully directing the team and assigning action items. This role builds useful professional skills, and rotating ensures no one person gets stuck with all of the administrative tasks to keep the team running.

**Note Taker:** Each student team member will be responsible for maintaining a “decision log” during at least one phase of the project. Entries in decision logs may include why the team went forward with one thing over another, how a problem got resolved, unresolved tasks or questions, etc. Decision logs will be housed in a common repo and accessible to students and instructional staff.

<!--
Next we'll talk briefly about team roles. In order to share the leadership and administrative burdens required for such a project, as well as get experience in both capacities, teams will rotate who is the program manager and who is the note taker. 

Note takers will be in charge of keeping a decision log that will be accessible to students and instructional staff. This log will include why certain courses of action were taken and not others

Program managers will assign tasks and keep the group on track during their respective turn in this role.
-->

# Daily Schedule

Project teams work synchronously or asynchronously, but they must have daily meetings as a whole group. 

Sample daily schedule
* Morning team stand-ups 
* Project work (multi-hour block)
* (Optional) ad hoc topic session (at most 2-3 times per phase)
* Lunch
* Project work (multi-hour block)
* (Optional) professional skills session or guest speaker (at most 1 per phase)
* End of day team meetings and stand-ups

<!--
During the capstone project phases, we will have  morning and afternoon “standups.” This is a very common industry practice, and for good reason! They allow group members an opportunity to raise issues or ask for help regarding anything that's blocking their work.

Every morning we'll take 10 minutes or less to share how your group will prioritize your time for the day and what you will feasibly get accomplished. Then at the end of the day, groups will come back together as a class to share what you accomplished during the day, anything you need help with, and what your focus will be the following day. This bookend standup structure will keep us on track and allow instructors to help as needed.
-->

# Questions?

<!--
We've covered our capstone project goals, deliverables, phases, team roles, final presentation expectations, and how our daily schedule will shift for the remainder of the course. Now that we have covered these basics, our next capstone-related session will get into project topic ideation and forming groups. Before we move on, however, what questions do you have on what we've gone over here?
