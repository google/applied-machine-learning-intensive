# Design Documents

---

# Objective
Give a brief description of the goals of your project. 

<!--
What questions do you hope to address? What value will you be adding to the space? 
-->

---

# Background
Describe the background and context for this project. 

<!--
What is the motivation for studying this topic? What other work has been done: what was good and where does it fall short? If your project is interdisciplinary, give an overview of the key ideas from the connecting disciplines. 
-->

---

# Data Collection
Describe your preliminary ideas for data collection and cleaning. 

<!--
Are you planning to use datasets that are already compiled? Will you need to pull supplemental information from additional sources? What plans do you have to clean and prepare your data? How much time are you budgeting for the data collection and cleaning process? 

*Note* Students frequently underestimate this step. It is important to remind them that sometimes 90 percent of this work is getting the data in a useable format. 
-->

# Detail Design/Ideas
Provide a detailed overview of the project design. 

<!--
How will you approach the problem? What ideas/experiments do you have planned? 

Tips:
* Focus on design, not implementation.
* A picture is worth a thousand words. A diagram or drawing of the data and model at times is much easier to understand than words.
* If describing alternatives (e.g., approach, platform, algorithm), explain why it’s not part of your design.
* If you take a different approach than originally designed, come back and update your design docs.

# Project Plan 
Provide a project plan that includes a list of intermediate goals, milestones, and timelines. Also include the schedule of when different team members will take on the program manager and note taker roles. 

<!--
You will update this project plan throughout the project. It will be a guide that keeps you on track and accountable. It may be helpful to think about the project management session as you create your plan. 
-->

# Fairness Considerations
Complete the ethical storyboarding activity. 

<!--
You will also complete this again as part of your final project, as it is critical to consider ethical implications early and often throughout any project. 

The ethical storyboarding worksheet asks your group to:
* describe a fictional person who was positively affected by a model trained with these data
* describe a fictional person who was negatively affected by a model trained with these data
* describe at least two sources of bias the particular model in your story could have
* describe at least one way you could modify the model to mitigate this bias
  * what can you do when designing our model to account for inherent bias in the input data?
* describe at least one way you could modify the dataset to mitigate this bias 
  * what could you do differently if you collected these data again? 
* describe at least one way you could modify the context surrounding the model to mitigate this bias
  * consider what human practices or policies you could put in place to protect people within the social system where this model is used

# References
Provide an annotated list of reference materials that you used in preparing these design documents, as well as any additional references that you plan to use in your project. 

<!--
For each reference provide a 1-2 sentence summary of the content and a brief description of how it was (or will be used).
