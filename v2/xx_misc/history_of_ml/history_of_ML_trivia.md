# History of ML Trivia

<!--
Today we're going to play a multiple choice trivia game. All of the questions are on the history and some milestones of the history of machine learning thus far. We haven't gone over these dates, advancements, famous people, and accomplishments, so you're going to have to rely on any prior knowledge and good old fashioned luck. Let's get started!
-->

# How to Play:

1. Count off to form random groups of 3-4 students.
1. Each team should tear their blank sheet of notebook paper into four and write **A** on one, then **B**, **C**, and **D** on the other three.
1. Each slide will contain one question. Your team will have **30 seconds** to deliberate and decide on your collective answer. 
1. Each team will display their answer at the same time. Each correct answer gets **one point**. No points will be deducted for wrong answers.
1. A final question will be worth **five points**.
1. You may not reference outside materials. Laptops down and cell phones off!
1. Let’s get started! 

<!--
First, I'm going to count everyone off in groups of 3-4 and give each team a piece of printer paper. One person on each team should tear the paper into four pieces and write A, B, C, and D on each quarter sheet.

Each slide will disply one question at a time. Each team will have 30 seconds to deliberate and decide on your answer. One person from each team will show their team's answer by holding up the corresponding sheet of paper: A, B, C, or D. 

Each correct answer earns a team one point. No points will be deducted for wrong answers. A final question will be worth five points.

You may not reference outside materials. 

Any questions?

# 1.) Which of these events occurred first?

a. George Boole created a form of algebra in which all values can be reduced to “true” or “false.” Essential to modern computing, Boolean logic helps a CPU decide how to process new inputs.

b. Inspired by how humans follow specific processes to perform tasks, English logician and cryptanalyst Alan Turing theorized how a machine might decipher and execute a set of instructions. The publication of his theory is considered the basis of computer science.

c. Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.

d. Neuroscientist Warren McCulloch and mathematician Walter Pitts wrote a paper on how human neurons might work. To illustrate the theory, they modeled a neural network with electrical circuits.
