# Warm-Up Exercise

* **ORANGE**: Describe a time when you took a risk… and it was thrilling.
* **GREEN**: Describe a time when you got really absorbed solving an intricate problem.
* **YELLOW**: Describe a time when you felt strongly committed to an organization or group of people.
* **BLUE**: Describe a time when you invested yourself in helping someone else to grow.

<!--

*Each participant should have a fun/snack sized bag of M&Ms.*

Pull out one M&M without looking. If it’s red or brown, put it aside (or eat it). Depending on the color of M&M pulled, reflect on the corresponding item on the screen for one minute.  Now turn to a person next to you and take 1-2 minutes each to share your reflection.

Any interesting stories to share with the group briefly?  (Take 2-3 volunteers.)

No matter what color M&M you may have picked, you would have been able to think of an instance in your life where that happened.  We are all a mix of these four traits. Being risky, being analytical, being committed, being nurturing - these exist in all of us to some degree.

Many of us find, however, that we are inclined toward one type more than the others. This session will give us a new lens to understand ourselves and others at work according to these four personality types.

*Talk about why learning to work with different work styles is or has been important to you. (application at work, understanding self, understanding others, being yourself while also meeting others where they are).*

# Why Use True Colors as a Tool?

* Simple and easy to apply
* Based on the same extensive research as Myers-Briggs (MBTI)
* Provides a common language for understanding ourselves and others at work

<!--
So why do we use True Colors as a tool?

First, it’s easy to understand and apply. For those who have taken Myers-Briggs, you know it’s complex. True Colors is quicker to grasp and easier to apply to ourselves and others in the workplace. Some large tech companies even use this framework in their leadership training. 

Also, it’s based on MBTI, which is extensively researched and has stood the test of time.

It helps us better understand ourselves and others, which can save a lot of time and headache.

*Distribute four large whiteboards or pieces of chart paper throughout the room and label them with one of the four True Colors: orange, gold, blue, green.*

When I say go, find your primary color group and begin discussing the four questions on the board. You will chart your answers to the questions, either with words, drawings, or whatever you’d like to use to describe your primary true color. You’ll have 15 minutes to work on this and then each group will present out to the group. What questions do you have?”

*Allow students 15 minutes to work and add 4-5 additional minutes if they need it.*

*After each presentation, allow non-presenting students an opportunity to ask questions: “What questions do you have for the blue group?”*
