# CD-08B: Peer Technical Interviews

<!--
Today we’re going to apply what we learned in our technical interview session by conducting and experiencing peer interviews. Today’s session is designed to give you the opportunity to interview AND be interviewed. It’s a perfect no-stakes time to get some real practice in, so I hope you take full advantage of it and treat it like an interview — both for your benefit and the benefit of the person you’re interviewing.

Let’s get started!

# Interviewing can be intimidating {.big}

<!--
Being interviewed can be intimidating. For many people, it’s the most nerve-wracking part of applying for a job. That’s a real problem, because anxiety and nervousness can keep you from performing your best.

# Peer interviewing: background

Switching roles and playing the part of the interviewer can make you more aware of what an interviewer is looking for

Peer interviews also provide an opportunity to practice responding to interview questions in a no-stakes setting


<!--
So what can you do to calm your nerves? One of the best ways to demystify the interview process is by switching roles: practicing being an interviewer yourself.  By mindfully putting yourself in the shoes of an interviewer, you can begin to internalize some important truths about interviewing. Peer interviewing also gives you a chance to practice answering interview questions without it determining whether or not you get a job. Win win!

# Peer interviewing: conversation

Interviewing as a conversation

**While you’re interviewing**: Think about how much smoother and less awkward the experience is when the candidate talks through their answers than when they think quietly. 

**The takeaway**: Don’t be afraid to talk to your interviewer. Being friendly, communicative and confident is almost as important as having good answers.

<!--
The first thing you’ll notice as an interviewer is that an interview is a conversation, not a standardized test. As an interviewer, you aren’t just looking for a correct answer; you’re also looking for a good social interaction. You want to know that the candidate is someone you’d like to work with.
While you’re interviewing, think about how much smoother and less awkward the experience is when the candidate talks through their answers than when they think quietly.
Your takeaway should be, don’t be afraid to talk to your interviewer. Being friendly, respectful, communicative, and confident is almost as important as having good answers.

# Peer interviewing: both parties want success

Your interviewer wants you to do well

**While you’re interviewing**: Think about how much better you feel when the candidate arrives at the right answer, and how much you want to help when they’re on the wrong track.

**The takeaway**: Don’t think of the interviewer as your adversary; they want you to succeed almost as much as you do. Ask questions when you’re unsure about anything, and they’ll usually do their best to help you.

<!--
You might also notice that as an interviewer, you naturally want your candidate to succeed. A successful interview is much more enjoyable than an unsuccessful one.
While you’re interviewing, think about how much better you feel when the candidate arrives at the right answer, and how much you want to help when they’re on the wrong track.
I hope you’ll glean from this that think of the interviewer is NOT your adversary. They want you to do well. Ask questions when you’re unsure about anything, and they’ll usually do their best to help you.

# Peer interviewing: using the rubric

**Interviewer**

* Uses the rubric to evaluate how the candidate is doing
* Provide feedback to the candidate based on the rubric

.

{.column}

**Interviewee**

* Should also use the rubric (after the interview) to reflect on how they did, improve answers, and consider what interviewers are looking for

.

<!--
Today’s activity will have an “interviewer” and “interviewee,”  each with a separate set of questions, and you will take turn interviewing one another and giving feedback for 45 minutes.

The interviewer will be provided a rubric to help evaluate the interviewee. By using the basic rubric on the back of this page to measure your mock candidate’s answers, you can also start to understand how your future interviewers will be evaluating your own answers. The rubric will help the interviewer give feedback.

# Reminders: giving & receiving feedback

**Giving feedback**
 
* Actionable
* Example-based
* Be specific, kind and direct
* Be sure to share things that went well, as well as things that could  be improved

1. *“I would try…”* 
1. *“I liked it when you said…”*
1. *“I noticed…”*

.

{.column}

**Receiving Feedback:**

* Don’t go back and forth or argue a point; let feedback wash over you
* Only take what you want. Feedback is a suggestion, so keep the points you think are important and let the rest go.

1. *“Thanks for your feedback.”*
1. *“I appreciate your suggestion.”*

.

<!--
The interviewer will provide feedback. Take a minute to gather your thoughts, and then make sure feedback is actionable, meaning that the interviewee can take an action to improve. You should also give an explicit example, especially of exact phrasing on answers that can be improved. Be sure to be as specific as possible, be kind, and be direct (but not mean). Also mention what went well, not only what could be improved. Try using the phrases here to give feedback. The interviewee should also take notes on feedback. 

When receiving feedback, remember feedback is a gift. It’s a way for people to show investment in you. At the same time, you only need to take what you want from it. Don’t dispute what your interviewer tells you. Go over feedback on your own and see where you need more practice or might improve.

# Selling yourself: clear and succinct

Your interviewer wants to know you’re the right candidate for the job . . .
* ... but they won’t know your skills and experience unless you tell them
* ...bexplaining what you’ve done can be surprisingly difficult! Practice, practice, practice.
* ... try writing down the key points, then practice delivering what you wrote

<!--
It’s critical in interviews to articulate your thought process and why you’ve done what you’ve done. This is why practicing is so important because you’ll do a lot of reps responding to questions, and as a result, you’ll be better with your words and explaining yourself when it counts most.

# Directions: time to interview!

* Choose who will go first as the interviewer and interviewee
* The interviewee should not look at the questions or rubric
* The interviewer should take notes so they can give the best possible feedback after the “interview”
* Try not to “break character” so this experience is as close to a “real” interview as possible 
* Interview lasts for 30-40 minutes, and the remaining time should be used for feedback
* After the first interview and feedback session, switch roles and start again on the second set of questions

<!--
After we go over these instructions, I’ll assign your partner and we’ll get started! 

First, you’ll head to a quiet part of the building or [insert another place] and then choose who will go first as the interviewee between the two of you. The interviewee should NOT look at the questions until it’s their turn to interview. One person’s questions are on the front of the handout I’m about to give you, and the other person’s questions are on the back. The interviewer should take notes so they give the most helpful feedback after the interview. Do your best not to break character. 

The interview should last for 30-40 minutes, and the remaining time should be used for feedback. After the interview and feedback, switch roles and begin on the second set of questions. 

You have 90 total minutes and need to hold yourselves accountable for timing and switching roles. Again, please use this time wisely to create an interview experience and get feedback.

What questions do you have before we get started?

[Divide students up into pairs that have been determined based on similar technical skill level.]

[Pass out CD-08B: Peer Technical Interview Questions Handout, assigning each student a set of questions by either handing them 

See you all back here at ____!

[Keep this slide up while students are dispersed interviewing, and progress to the next slide when they return.]

# Next steps

**Questions or comments?**
* What was this experience like? Anything you want to ask or share?

**Review feedback**
* Review the feedback you got today. Think about how you may rephrase some things and where you could improve. 

**Additional practice**
* I’ll pass out a second set of questions if you want to do this exercise again. Please pick a different partner.

**Don’t forget!** 
* None of these questions asked about a specific job, company, or team. Do not forget to come to an interview prepared to answer WHY them, WHY this role, and WHY you!

<!--
[Project this slide when everyone is back in the classroom after interviewing.]

Thank you all so much for participating in two back-to-back interviews! What was this experience like? Is there anything you’d like to comment on regarding either interviewing or being interviewed? 

[Solicit student contributions, and respond to each.]

Before we close out, I encourage you to review the feedback you received today from your partner. Consider revisiting some of your answers while they’re fresh in your mind and maybe writing out improved ones to reference for next time. 

If you’d like additional practice interviewing, I’ll be passing out a second set of interview questions and suggest choosing a different partner to diversity the interview experience.

[Pass out CD-08B: Peer Technical Interview Questions (B) to students.]

Last but definitely not least, please don’t forget to come to an interview prepared  to answer why you’re interested in that role and that company. These answers should be very specific. Also be prepared  to answer why they should choose you. Don’t underestimate the power of enthusiasm here. People are proud of where they work and want other people to feel the same way!
