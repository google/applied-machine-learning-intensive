# Career Development: The Art of Networking

<!--
This career development session is about the art of networking. If you’re thinking of a LAN, WAN, or MAN or linking computers together, we’re actually talking about a different type of networking today. But do hold on to the idea of creating a connection or link between two things. In this case, the link is between people.

# What is Networking?

Interacting meaningfully with other people to exchange information and develop contacts, especially to further one’s career

![](res/artofnetworking01.jpg)

<!--
* As college students you have many opportunities to begin making connections with others and building your network, so now is a great time to begin learning the skills of networking.
* Many people believe that networking is something you’re born with; some people are just better than others. The truth is that anyone can learn how to network effectively, and you’ll also improve a lot with practice.

# Where Does Networking Take Place?

Both formal and informal settings:
* Career fairs
* On-campus events
* Affinity groups
* Family events
* Anywhere - coffee shops, elevators, riding the bus, and through many kinds of activities

<!--
* You may think networking only takes place in formal settings. like at a career fair or an advertised “networking” event. You should be extra prepared for those kinds of events where you know networking will be explicitly taking place, but you may be surprised to learn that meaningful networking can be accomplished almost anywhere.
* Networking can happen in places you visit all the time, such as during your daily commute, at Starbucks, or even at your next family event.
* You never know who you’ll meet, which is why you should practice networking skills so you’ll be absolutely ready to network whenever you meet people who could be helpful to you or to whom you could be helpful.

*Feel free to share your own example of a time you or someone you know took advantage of a networking opportunity outside of a typical "networking" event. What was the result? What did you or this person learn?

* It's important to read social cues and make sure it’s an appropriate to strike up a conversation. If someone looks busy, is not receptive to a hello, or is on the phone, it might not be a good time to attempt networking.
-->

# What Does Networking Consist Of?

* Introduction
* Pleasantries
* Listening closely
* Asking questions
* Deciding on some next step, or making a request/offer
* Exchange contact information
* Following up

<!--
* In a more formal setting, like a career fair where everyone is there expecting to hear about opportunities, networking would probably be more formulaic. You would introduce yourself by saying who you are and what you study or are there for. Perhaps you'd make a bit of small talk (the weather, have they visited here before, if they're an alum), depending on if others are waiting in line behind you. Then it's best to listen closely and either offer to follow up or make a request before parting. Then you’d need to follow up on whatever was decided.
* For example, if you go to a career fair, you may walk up and say “Hi! How are you?” Maybe you follow that up with a tiny bit of small talk and then “I’m NAME, a senior at Spelman College, studying Computer Science. I’m interested in summer internships. "Is your company offering any summer internships in software engineering?” You can listen carefully and ask follow-up questions, including asking if the representative will take your resume, or if you should email it. You should also ask for a card or a way to stay in contact, and then make a request: “May I send you my resume for you to review?” or “May I follow up with you directly on the opportunities you mentioned?” Or the rep may say, “I’ll email you with opportunities." Either way, you’ve decided on next steps and you would go home and send a thank you email or any next step you decided on.

# Networking DOs and DON'Ts

![](res/artofnetworking02.jpg)

<!--
In the next few slides, we will go over ways to effectively network, as well as some things that may detract from building a good network.

# 1. DO: use technology to network 

* Thanks to technology, networking has never been easier
* But using the right technology to network can be confusing
  * Email, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter?
  * Use technology, but then step away!
* Follow up promptly after discussing opportunities in a networking context
  * Give context! Remind them of your name and any specifics of your convo
     1. “I was also a Girl Scout Gold Award recipient and I love coding in Java.”
  * Try to follow up within two days

<!--
* If you can believe it, you used to have to exchange paper resumes to network professionally, which made everything much slower and more complicated
* Now, thanks to technology, we can network with one another more easily than ever before using a myriad of platforms.
* The down side of that is that with so many options for connecting, it can be difficult to decide the right one. Social media is messy. Across Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, and other social networks, we are connected to a mix of close friends, college buddies, high school classmates, co-workers, bosses, former bosses, I-met-you-at-a-party-once acquaintances, and people we've never even seen face-to-face. It's important to understand the particular platform that you're using, as well as the type of relationship you have with a person, before attempting to leverage that connection for professional gain. Each social media platform has a certain reputation. For instance, LinkedIn is generally a business site, while Twitter is more "laid back" and often mixes professional and personal content. Respect the way that people use these sites. Adding a professional acquaintance as a friend on Facebook can be invasive, especially if that individual is a traditionalist who uses Facebook purely for personal contact with friends and family. Likewise, asking an old friend for a recommendation on LinkedIn might create awkwardness if the person has no experience with you in a professional capacity. LinkedIn is the quintessential social media site for forging business and work connections. Twitter can be a useful tool for interacting with the business as a whole, or for keeping up with their work, while Facebook and Instagram are more personal outlets.
* Also, while technology is great for staying in touch and keeping track of contacts, nothing is a substitute for a face-to-face conversation and interaction, so whenever possible, be sure to schedule time to actually talk. Social networking is a way to keep track of relationships, but is not necessarily a way to build lasting relationships.
* Along the same lines, when you meet someone through social media, ask for their preferred method of contact. Some people are big e-mailers, while others love talking on the phone or meeting for coffee. Respect their preferences.
-->

---

# 2. DON'T: come across as transactional

* Don’t approach contacts only when you need a favor
* Do look for ways to support the other person
* Make networking a two-way street, be conversational
* Pay it forward

<!--
* Continuously look for ways to give back to the people in your online networks.
* Don't approach them only when you need a favor. Reach out to say hello or to contribute something you think will be valuable to them.
* Networking is a two-way street. Plus, in the end, it's your reputation that counts.
* Also, because you will benefit from networking, look for ways to also help others. Opportunities to help colleagues who may be younger than you or even just in need of networking help themselves will increase as you become more successful. Whether you pay it forward by introducing a friend to a contact you think could be helpful to them or eventually become a mentor yourself, it completes the full cycle when you’re also in a place to give back to others.
* (Consider using a real world example of inappropriate use of calling people, LinkedIn requests, etc)
-->

---

# 3. DO: make a specific request

* Vagueness can lead to a lack of results
* Be respectful of someone’s time
* Make a specific “ask”
* Never just send your resume - always make a note with a specific request

<!--
* When you approach someone for career help via social media, know what you want out of the interaction and ask specific questions that show you've done your research. Often, people send messages along the lines of "I'm looking to go into marketing. Any advice or leads would be greatly appreciated!" or "Can you tell me more about this job?" in a Twitter DM. These types of messages are so broad that it's difficult to provide a meaningful and relevant response.
* Working professionals are strapped for time. Make it easy for them to help you — specify what you're looking for. Is it the person's time? Connections to certain individuals? Advice on a particular topic? Knowledge about a company? Do you want them to act as a reference? Introduce you to a recruiter at their organization? Provide a critique of your resume?
  * Example: do not email a recruiter and say “I’m a junior CS student - where does my profile fit within Google?
  * What you could say is: I have a Math minor and know from reading that Chrome needs engineers with this background. Do you think there would be opportunities for me here?
* You need to showcase your skills and value, show us you’ve done their research on roles and qualifications, and ask specific questions when you have them.
-->

---

# 4. DO: personalize all communication

* Do your homework! Make sure to check the the spelling of a person’s name, title, organization, and all other details
  * Also make sure you have the right gender pronoun, when unsure, just use their name instead
* Express appreciation for their time and interest
* Explain why you want to connect

<!--
* It will be important to your career going forward to have great attention to detail and to show this is something important to you, and you do that by showing you have done research
* Tips: pay attention to detail, and if you know this is challenging for you, have a friend proofread important emails or read aloud to make sure everything makes sense before sending.
* From LinkedIn connection requests to advice-seeking Facebook messages to 140-character chatter on Twitter, you should customize every communication sent on social networks. It shows that you value your unique connection with the recipient. It's easy for people to feel used when you send them a generic request or a message that's clearly copy-and-pasted to dozens of others (especially if you forget to change the names!).
* For existing connections, express an understanding and appreciation for the relationship. When you reach out for advice, give consideration to the other person. Ask pertinent questions about them, especially if you've been out of touch for a while. Be honest and open. When requesting a recommendation on LinkedIn, for example, always customize your request to reflect how you value the person's endorsement.
* For new relationships, explain why you want to connect with this particular individual. What is it about her background that makes her an appealing person to talk to? Show that you've done your homework. Know about the person's work history and professional accomplishments, as well as anything career-related you two have in common. Never send an introductory message to a potential connection asking, "So, what exactly does your company do?"

**Practice A - Following up With Someone You Met Briefly** 

You made some polite small talk and then exchanged business cards with this person at a networking event. Now—rather than letting that contact information collect dust in your desk drawer—you want to take the next step to forge a relationship.

What are some things we want to include as we craft this email?

<!--
**Ask a student to read the slide. Before clicking on the next slide, get some answers from the audience. Possible ideas:
* Reference where you met**
* Reference something you talked about
* An ask - share an article, share you resume, ask a question about where they work, continue the conversation...etc
-->

**Practice A [Template]** 

Hello [Name],

I hope you’re having a great [day of the week].

It was so nice to meet you at [place where you met] and chat about [topic you talked about]. After our conversation, I found this article about [relevant topic]. I thought you’d find it interesting, so I figured I’d pass it along.

Again, I really enjoyed meeting you and I’m looking forward to keeping in touch. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to get together and bounce around some more ideas about [topic]. I’d love that!

Wishing you the best,

[Your name]

<!--
This template is an example and certainly not the only way to follow up after meeting someone. Maybe you chatted about a particular resource, book, professor, product launch, study, job description, or any other thing you said you’d pass along. An article is just one way of working to begin solidifying the connection and not letting it drop off.
-->

---

**Practice A [Example]**

Hello Imani,

I hope you’re having a great Friday.

It was so nice to meet you at the Code For Good Hackathon and chat about trends in AI. After our conversation, I found this article about how Fortnite uses Artificial Intelligence and Analytics to make the game more fun, which reminded me of our conversation about Gaming and AI. I thought you’d find it interesting, so I figured I’d pass it along.

Again, I really enjoyed meeting you and I’m looking forward to keeping in touch. Don’t hesitate to reach out if you want to get together and bounce around some more ideas about click-worthy article titles. I’d love that!

Hope to hear from you,

Josh

<!--
Here, we went with an article to keep the conversation going - a great option if you aren’t sure of the exact next steps, but want to keep the conversation open and add this person to your professional network. You could also make your “ask” to pass along your resume. We’ll see an example next that simply asks for an informational meeting as a next step.
-->

---

**Practice B - Requesting an Informational Interview**

You don’t just want to connect with this person—you want to learn from them. You’re eager to set up an informational interview (or even a more informal coffee date or email chat) where you can come prepared with a list of questions you want answers to.

What do we want to keep in mind as we write this email?

<!--
Ask a student to read the slide. Before clicking on the next slide, get some answers from the audience.
Possible ideas:
* Who you are
* How you know about them (or if you met them briefly - when and where)
* An ask, in this case, to meet up
* Meeting up is a BIG ask, so give them an “out” to possibly answer questions by email if they don’t have time to meet up
-->

---

**Practice B [Template]** 

Hello [Name],

I hope you’re doing well!

My name is [Your name], and I’m a [job title] with [Company]. I really admire your [work/experience] with [outlet]. I’m interested in finding out more about [area] myself and was hoping you’d be willing to provide some insights from your experience.

If you’re open to it, I’d love to buy you a cup of coffee sometime soon so I can ask you some questions and learn more about you and your [journey/career path]. I understand your schedule may be busy, so, alternatively, I’m also happy to pass along some questions via email or connect by phone.

Looking forward to hearing from you, [Name]!

Best,

[Your Name]

<!--
The ask is for the informational meeting is there, but so is the option to follow up by email. This email template assumes you don’t know the person. If you DID know this person, you would just edit like the email we saw previously, adding how you know them to jog their memory and then going ahead with your ask for an informational meeting.
-->

**Practice B [Example]**

Hello Mitch,


My name is Andre and I’m currently a student in a Google-sponsored intensive where I am building my Machine Learning and Data Science skills. I heard you speak about the ethics involved with data analytics and the work you are doing with the AI Ethics Research Group at the Kaggle Conference. I’m really interested in the important work happening in the space of ML fairness myself and was hoping you’d be willing to provide some insights from your experience.


If you’re open to it, I’d love to buy you a cup of coffee sometime soon so I can ask you some questions and learn more about you and your work. I understand your schedule may be busy, so, alternatively, I’m also happy to pass along some questions via email or connect by phone.


Looking forward to hearing from you, Mitch!

Best,

Andre

<!--
Notice this is a very specific request Mitch is making. Also notice he is providing multiple options for Rachel to choose from regarding how to connect. If Rachel agrees to chat with Mitch, she is doing the favor and therefore should choose the medium.

**Practice C - Connecting With a Friend of a Friend**

Your friend or colleague recommended that you reach out to one of his acquaintances, as he thought you’d have a lot to connect on. Rather than making an introduction, he passed along that person’s contact information and encouraged you to get in touch.

What do we want to be sure to include in this instance?

<!--
Before clicking on the next slide, get some answers from the audience.
Possible ideas:
* The person you have in common
* How you know that common contact
* What did your mutual contact think you have in common?
* An ask - why are you getting in touch with them?
-->

---

**Practice C [Template]**

Hello [Name],

My name is [your name], and I [how you know mutual contact] [mutual contact’s name], who passed along your contact information to me.


[Mutual contact’s name] mentioned we share a [passion for/interest in/experience with] [shared interest] and said you’d be a great person to get to know. So, I thought I’d reach out, introduce myself, and let you know that I’d love to find out more about you and your experience with [specific area].


Looking forward to connecting, [Name]!

All the best,

[Your Name]

<!--
Maybe it’s a shared passion or interest, or maybe it’s a job or career you may be interested in. You can tailor this template accordingly so that it meets your needs.

**Practice C [Example]**

Hello David,

My name is Sidnie, and I’m good friends with Clint, who passed along your contact information to me.


Clint mentioned we share a passion for dog rescues and said you’d be a great person to get to know! So, I thought I’d reach out, introduce myself, and let you know that I’d love to find out more about you and your experience with Saving Paws Rescue.


Would you possibly have 15-20 minutes to connect in person, over Skype, or via phone in the next few weeks?

Looking forward to connecting, David!

All the best,

Sidnie

<!--
Here’s a good reminder that these best practices can be used for personal networking and hobbies as well as purely professional.

# 5.) DON'T: Forget to Say Thank You

* Send a follow up email, or even better - a handwritten thank you note when possible
* Let your contacts know the outcome when they’ve helped you out
* No act is too simple to express gratitude to someone

<!--
* Always send someone a “thank you” email, even if it’s just to thank them for a brief conversation, if at all possible, it’s a great idea to send someone a thank you note if you can easily access their mailing address (you should use their professional mailing address) It will set you apart in a time when most people will use technology. Just make sure to use careful handwriting and spelling.
* If someone connected you with an interview for a job, funding for a startup, or a donation to a cause you are championing, let them know the outcome, send an email letting them know you got the job, grew your company by 5%, or raised $5,000 for ALS research. Whatever the outcome, thank them for their time, making the connection, or their donation.
* It's a simple step that many people miss. Show appreciation when someone does something nice for you online. Whether it's responding to a few questions, retweeting a link to your blog post, or even connecting you with one of their friends — it's always appropriate to express your gratitude. It's especially important to follow-up after someone has provided advice. People like to feel helpful, so let them know if their advice was useful for you.
-->

---

# 6.) DO: Use Appropriate Salutations/Closings

* “Hi” is fine for casual emails, but “Hello” is better for more formal emails
  * “Dear” is probably antiquated at this point
  * “To Whom It May Concern” is too nonspecific - try to narrow it down
* Use “Mr./Ms.” for more formal, but if you are not sure, just use their first name
  * Not sure if they are a “Dr.”? Try to do some research
* For closing, “Best” is BEST, “With Regards” for more formal writing
  * Do NOT “Cheers” - sounds like you are going drinking, and “Yours” sounds like a love note closing in high school :)

<!--
* Just a quick note on how to open and close emails - you can show some personality here, within reason, but you don’t want your opening/closing/or subject line to be silly or distracting.
* If you are not sure of the gender of the person you are emailing for some reason, use their name only. “Miss” and “Mrs.” guess at a woman’s married status and are pretty passeé now. “Mx.” is gaining traction as a gender neutral greeting, but hasn’t fully caught on yet. However, if someone refers to themselves this way, by all means use it
* As a general rule, follow the lead of the person introducing you, or how the person refers to themselves. You always start more formally, unless the person is very close in age to you. If the person then asks you to refer to them by their first name, do that
* If you’re not sure if someone has an MD or PhD and your research doesn’t give you an answer, use your best judgment. If they are faculty, you can always say “Professor” this still shows respect for their education and role, even if you aren’t sure of their credentials
* For signing off, use your best judgment. I like “Best” - “Best Wishes” sounds a little too fluffy to me, but is still fine. “Regards” also works, but is pretty formal and a little stiff. Personally, “Cheers” and “Yours” don’t work for me.
Does anyone have a signoff they use that they want advice on? [Elicit student contributions and respond to each.]
-->

---

# 7.) DO: Be Ready to Meet People! 

* Have a firm handshake
* Have your resume updated and ready to go
* Save contacts somewhere centralized with notes
* Treat everyone you meet with respect
* **Activity**: shake hands with as many people in the room as you can for the next 30 seconds

<!--
* A firm handshake is still very important; avoid being TOO firm, but when you shake hands, firmly grasp the right hand of the person with your right hand only, then pump up and down once or twice only while making eye contact and exchanging names, saying “nice to meet” you and remembering to smile between all that! If you know you have sweaty hands (a lot of people do especially when they are nervous, subtly wipe your palms first as you walk up)
* Always have your resume updated and ready to go, saved as a PDF, or on Google drive. Leave off the objective so you don’t have to continually personalize. Spend time after every new role you take adding that information. You wouldn’t believe how many opportunities people miss by not having an updated resume saved to their computers.
* Business cards disappear easily, so transfer contacts to your phone, email or another centralized place. If possible, make a quick note of title, company, and anything else as a small note that will remind you of who this person is and what you talked about  - they may not be someone you think will be an important contact now, but you never know, so try to keep a record and details to jog your memory.
* Along those lines, you never know who will be in a position to help you or give you advice now or in the future, so remember to treat everyone with respect.
* Set a timer for 30 seconds, make everyone get up and PRACTICE an appropriate handshake, eye contact, and a positive, confident introduction!
-->

---

# 8.) DO: Craft Your Elevator Pitch

* Be ready to succinctly describe who you are, what you do, and what your goals are
* Practice!
* Keep your “pitch” up to date

<!--
* You should practice being able to describe who you are, what your goals are, and what you’re involved in. Trust me, you’ll use this at everything from career fairs to family weddings.
* You may want to slightly tailor your pitch based on different roles you hold  - for instance, you may have a “pitch” about where you go to school, what you want to study, and the kinds of careers or opportunities you are looking for when you got to something like a career fair, but if you are at a meeting for club presidents and you head up the Computer Science club, you may have a pitch of what your club does, how many members you have, and your goals for this year.
* There will always be a reason to sell what you do in a very short window of time. It will always play in your favor if you maintain the ability to do that in a way that manages to cover who you are, what you do, and why it’s relevant. Try to come off as casual, efficient, and not forced or pushy. Easy, right? We know it’s not, which is why you should practice ahead of time. * In a mirror. Repeatedly. And, like a resume, elevator pitches need periodic updating.
-->

# Activity

* Spend two minutes crafting your one-minute elevator-pitch. Include your name, where you attend school, your major, and opportunities that interest you, like an internship or full time job in a specific field.
* Pick a partner and take turns giving your elevator pitches; start out by shaking their hand, looking them in the eye, and then saying your pitch.
* Solicit feedback from your partner. Don’t forget feedback on the handshake, too!
* Take one more turn if you have time, using the feedback you were given.

<!--
Let’s craft or fine-tune our elevator pitches so we’re ready to meaningfully connect with people when those opportunities arise!

# Next Steps

Open up your laptop, reach out to one connection on LinkedIn (or another platform of your choosing) to let them know what you’re up to and share your resume or set up next steps like any of those we reviewed today.

If you do not have a LinkedIn profile, please make one and be sure to include AMLI as an experience! Our next career development session is about LinkedIn!

<!--
Circulate to help students formulate emails, respond to recruiters, etc. If students say they don’t have anyone to reach out to - how about a faculty speaker, or just someone they can send a “thank you” and update to? Doesn’t have to be a cold email.
