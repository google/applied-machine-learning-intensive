    "So far in this course, the data that we have encountered has been in some text format, such as comma separated values of strings and numbers. Other data has been directly loaded from scikit-learn as a `Bunch` of NumPy arrays, also containing strings and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data scientists sometimes find themselves working with collections of images, which are represented in a much more compact binary format. One of the most common examples of working with images is image classification, e.g., reverse image search.\n",
    "\n",
    "These images are often contained in a zip file, but they can also be in a directory on your computer or even on the internet. Once you have the images, you'll typically need to perform some type of preprocessing on them before you can do any sort of modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most models expect a specific size of image, so you'll need to resize the images you feed your model if they differ from what is expected. Resizing might include cropping, stretching, padding, and scaling an image. Resizing to a smaller size also helps speed up your model by reducing the size of the input data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Images can also be encoded in many different ways. Some are grayscale; others are color. Color images might be encoded red-green-blue (RGB), blue-green-red (BGR), rgb-alpha, bgr-alpha, hue-saturation-lightness (HSL), hue-saturation-value (HSV), or some other encoding scheme. You will need to make sure your input images' encoding for all of your training data is the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also common to normalize or standardize your images, which are just two different ways of reducing a wide range of pixel values (typically `0 `to `255` inclusive) into a tighter range.\n",
    "\n",
    "This might all sound like a lot of work, and it is. Fortunately, though, you don't have to worry too much about the details. There are numerous Python toolkits for manipulating images. In this unit, we will use the [Image](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html) and [ImageOps](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/ImageOps.html) modules from the [PIL (now called Pillow)](https://python-pillow.org/) library."
