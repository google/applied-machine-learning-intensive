# Types of Bias

* Reporting
* Automation
* Selection (Coverage, Non-response, Sampling)
* Group Attribution (In-group, Out-group)
* Implicit (Confirmation, Experimenters)

<!--
Biases can be found throughout the design and development of ML systems. Stay in the same groups of three. Do a two-part activity to identify different types of bias. 

Part 1 asks students to use cards to match nine descriptive examples with nine different types of bias (Bias Card Matching). Part 2 asks students to pair-share or volunteer-share what instances of these bias types they’ve encountered in their own experience.

If you have a concrete example of bias in ML systems from your own experience, share how it was detected and handled.

# Ethical Storyboarding

* What ML Fairness risks exist?
* How would a “fair” model behave?
* How can we mitigate risks?
  * Model
  * Dataset
  * Context

<!--
It’s important to remember that ML algorithms and systems are built, trained, and evaluated by people. They are affected by human cognitive limitations and biases. To create systems that work for everyone, we have to intentionally work to mitigate those issues. It’s also important to note that fairness is *subjective.* Not all biases should be approached the same way. 

In the same groups of three, have students work on the Ethical Storyboarding activity for some ML example (chosen from the bias cards or other). Discuss what ML Fairness risks might exist for their specific product, and what research/feedback mechanisms could help mitigate those issues.

After ~25 minutes, debrief the class all together.
ASK:
* What do they perceive as main takeaways from this exercise?
* What does this mean to them, for their role as up-and-coming professionals in ML?
* What are questions they still have?
