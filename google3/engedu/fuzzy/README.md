# Applied Machine Learning Intensive

The [Applied Machine Learning Intensive](https://edu.google.com/computer-science/applied-computing-series/intensive.html)
is a 10-week bootcamp-style course that teaches students how to build, tune, and
apply multiple types of machine learning models. The types of models span from
classical statistical models through cutting-edge deep learning models.

The majority of the course content is provided as Jupyter Notebooks that are
hosted on the [Colab](http://colab.research.google.com) platform.
