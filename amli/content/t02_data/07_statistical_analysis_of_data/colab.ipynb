        "A simple random sample (SRS) is one of the most common statistical sampling techniques, and it involves a randomly selection of a subset of data.  A SRS is unbiased because every member of the population has an equal opportunity to be selected.

For example, a sample obtained from the Census Bureau in 2010 collected information on residents across the U.S.  Surely not every resident responded to their requests, so the ones that did are assumed to be a representative sample.  This experiment has some selection bias, as the folks who tend to be at home during the day are either very young, or very old.  Another example would be political polling; those at home ready to answer the phone tend to be older, yielding a bias sample of voters.\n",
        "\n",
        "Confirmation bias, a form of cognitive bias, can affect online and offline behavior. Those who believe that the earth is flat, are more likely to spread misinformation that supports flat-earth rather than facts which dispel the claim, perpetuating such a falsehood.  Youtube's algorithm is then bias to show more flat earth video suggestions to those who've watched at least one. Those video suggestions then feed back into the users' confirmation bias.\n",

Data Scientists of all skill levels can experience pitfalls in their design and implementation strategies, if not aware of the source of some bias in experiment design, or error in data sources or collection strategies.\n",

Interval data does not actually have a zero value. Even though absolute zero is the bottom limit for temperature, Kelvin's floor value of zero is not actually measureable, because the absence of temperature or true zero does not exist. \n",

A feature can be binary (containing only two classes), or multicategory (containing more than two classes).  In the case of coin flip data, you have either a heads or a tails because the coin cannot land on both or none.  If a feature has more than two categories that would be called a multiclass feature.  For instance, life can be divided into 7 classes (animal, plant, fungus, protists, archaebacteria, and eubacteria) \n",

It should be noted that the differences between each level of ordinal data are assumed to be equivalent, when in reality they may not be.

        "Devising an experiment involves separating some of the ideas that you might have had before, during, and after the experiment. Let's say you are selling popcorn at a movie theater, and you have three sizes, small, medium, and Jumbo for `$`3.00, `$`4.50, or `$`6.50 . At the end of the week, the total sales are as follows 200, 100, 50 for sm, med, and lg respectively.  You also have an advertisement for medium popcorn on sale for `$`4.50, and you think that if you sell more jumbo sizes, that you make more money, so you decide to post an ad for jumbo popcorn.  Your hypothesis is as follows: I will get more weekly sales on average with a jumbo ad versus a medium ad.  \n",
        "\n",
        "#### A-A Testing\n",
        "To test this hypothesis we first must look at some historical data so that we can validate that our control is what we think it is.  Our hypothesis for this case is that there is no difference in week-to-week sales using the Ad for Medium popcorn.  If we test this hypothesis, we can use an F-test to compare some week in the past to all other weeks, or a 1-sample t-test to compare against the population mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### A-B Testing\n",
        "Assuming that we have validated the historical data using an A-A test for the old ad for medium popcorn, we can now test against the new ad for Jumbo popcorn.  If we then collect data for the new ad for several weeks, we can use a 2-sided t-test to compare.  In this experiment, we will collect data for several weeks or months using the control (The medium ad), and repeat for the test (The Jumbo Ad).\n",
        "\n",
        "The most important aspect of hypothesis testing is the assumptions that you make about the control and the test groups. The null hypothesis in all cases would be the inverse of your hypothesis.  In A-A testing, the null hypothesis is that there is no difference amongst samples, and in the case of A-B testing, the null states that there is no difference between a control, and a test sample.  A successful A-A test is one in which you fail to reject the null, in other words, there are no differences inside your control group, it is more or less homogenous.  A successful A-B test is one where you you reject the null hypothesis, observing a significant difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Evaluating an Experiment\n",
        "Using a t-test or another statistical test like F-test, ANOVA or Tukey HSD, we can measure the results of our experiment with two statistics.  The t-statistic informs us of the magnitude of the observed difference between samples, and the p-value tells us how likely that observed difference is due to random chance or noise.  Most statisticians and data scientists use 0.05 as an upper limit to a p-value, so any test that results in a p-value less than 0.05 would indicate that the difference observed is not likely due to random chance.\n"
