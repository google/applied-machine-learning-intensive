# PREVENT MERGE CONFLICTS - TEXT BEFORE WORKING!

# Suggested Components from starting document:
# Enforce rules mentioned in Style Guide ()
# Implement Spelling and Grammar Checks
# All exercises and challenges have answer key
# Colabs all use Python 3
# Colabs don't have saved outputs on


# Notes
# Use Python 3: Done!
# Spell Check: Blocked
# Contains Answer Key: Pretty Close - worried about wording (exercise v. challenge) (solutions v. answer keys)
# Outputs Off: Done!
