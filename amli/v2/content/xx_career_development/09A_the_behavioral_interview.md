# CD-9A: The Behavioral Interview

<!--
Today we’re going to talk about behavioral interviews. While aspiring and established engineers, scientists, and IT professionals like yourselves need to prepare for technical interviews, you ALSO need to be prepared for behavioral interview questions. These questions can be very different from technical interview questions you may get, but they are not hard to master if you come prepared. 

Behavioral interview questions are important to understand and practice because, unlike a technical interview where you display skills you have for the interviewer to see and assess, behavioral interviews ask you to accurately, quickly, and effectively draw upon academic or professional experiences you’ve had in the past and communicate them in a compelling way to your interviewer. It doesn’t matter if you’ve done extraordinary work in the past if you aren’t fluent in conveying that work.

I also want to point out that behavioral and technical interviews aren’t mutually exclusive. Employers can ask both in the same interview and event integrate elements of both in the same question. To perform well with both, it’s critical that you have a firm grasp on the school and/or professional work you’ve done and are able to explain it clearly. 

Let’s dive in!

# Basic interview protocol recap

* Before → 
  * Research company’s history, mission, and the job description fully
  * Come prepared with 2-3 things you like about the opportunity
  * Be able to clearly articulate why you’re a good fit
* During → 
  * Dress up! Even if the work place is casual, dress a notch above that.
  * Shake hands, make eye contact, skew answers toward the positive
* After → 
  * Thank your interviewer(s)
  * Send a same-day thank you email that’s tailored to the interview

<!--
Here’s a quick recap on basic interview protocol. It’s extremely important to come prepared to an interview having researched the company, its history, the role, and why you’re a good fit for the role. It’s possible that you don’t meet all the requirements they’re looking for the role -- this is very common! But you can stand out as an especially desirable candidate by being passionate about the organization and the work it’s doing. 

Always dress up for an interview. Don’t take a guess about whether or not a workplace is casual. If the recruiter or interviewer tells you in advance of the interview that attire is casual, still wear business casual to the interview. If the workplace is NOT casual, definitely wear business attire -- a business suit. 

Much like in your work with recruiters, show gratitude to your interviewers. Thank them during the interview and then in a same-day thank you email that mentions something you specifically enjoyed about the interview and that excites you about the role or the company. Sometimes you may not have access to the interviewer’s contact information. In that case, you should forward personalized thank you emails to your recruiter or whomever set up your interviews and ask them to pass your notes along. It’s important to remember that some interviewers could be your future boss, but other interviewers can be employees at the company whose job involves interviewing from time to time. It’s because people make time for that in their work that you’re able to interview in a timely way, so it’s important to show appreciation for their time.

# Options

**Technical interviews assess**

* Role-specific technical knowledge
* Problem-solving abilities
* How you think
* Communication skills
* How you get to your answer

Prevalent with employers hiring for engineering, science, and IT roles

.

{.column}

**Machine Learning**

Behavioral interviews assess
* Likelihood of future behavior based on past behavior
* How you’ve responded in specific situations
* The measurable skills and value you brought to those situations

Prevalent with employers hiring for any role

.

<!--
As we learned from the technical interview session prior to this one, technical interviews assess your technical knowledge for a given role, your problem-solving abilities, and what the process of getting to your answer entailed. Your skills are on display in real time.

Behavioral interviews, on the other hand, assess your likelihood of future behavior based on past behavior. The interviewer wants to know how you’ve responded in specific situations and the measurable skills you’ve brought to those situations. Behavioral interview questions often start with, “Tell me about a time when....” or “Describe a time when…”

# Behavioral interview basics

Sample behavioral interview questions:

* Describe a situation that required you to consider a different perspective when exploring an issue.
* Describe a project that required input from people at different levels in the organization.
* Tell me about a time you went above and beyond the call of duty to get things done. 
* Tell me about two improvements you have made in the last six months.
* Tell me about a time that you took the lead on a difficult project.
* Describe a time when you found it difficult to work with someone from a different background.
* Describe a time when you anticipated potential problems and developed preventive measures.
* Tell me about a time when you had to analyze information and make a recommendation.

# Behavioral interview basics

Interviewers want to know

* How your past job performance could support their company’s needs
* “...about a time when…” not, “what you would do if…”
* How you define terms like, “difficult person,” “pressure at work,” “greatest accomplishment,” etc based on your answers
* If you can communicate clearly. There are no wrong answers, but there are subpar answers
   * 1-2 minutes long
   * Anticipate follow-up questions

<!--
Interviewers are asking questions like those in the previous slide in order to determine if your past job and academic performance can support their company’s needs. They’re also interested in knowing how you define terms like “difficult person” and “greatest accomplishment.” If you describe a “difficult person” as a boss who wanted you to meet deadlines and your “greatest accomplishment” as getting a higher grade than the guy you hate in statistics class, understand that these will be red flags. Craft your answers in a way that tell the truth and that also position you as a team player, leader, problem solver and someone who values diversity and is willing to receive and implement feedback. Now, we can’t authentically convey that we are all of those things in every answer we give. But it’s important to keep in mind how your word choice and story choice come across to an interviewer.

It’s also very important that you communicate clearly and don’t give long-winded answers. 1-2 minute answers are more than enough to start. Your interviewer will ask follow-up questions.
