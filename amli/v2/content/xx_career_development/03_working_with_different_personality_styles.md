# Warm-up exercise

* **ORANGE**: Describe a time when you took a risk… and it was thrilling.
* **GREEN**: Describe a time when you got really absorbed solving an intricate problem.
* **YELLOW**: Describe a time when you felt strongly committed to an organization or group of people.
* **BLUE**: Describe a time when you invested yourself in helping someone else to grow. 

<!--
[Each participant should have a fun/snack sized bag of M&Ms.]

Activity: “Pull out one M&M without looking. If it’s RED or BROWN, put it aside (or eat it). Depending on the color of M&M pulled, reflect on the corresponding item above (1 minute).  Now turn to a person next to you, and take 2 minutes each to share.”

Debrief: “Any interesting stories to share with the group briefly?”  (Take 2-3 volunteers.)  

Then wrap up the activity by stating the main takeaway:  “No matter what color M&M you may have picked, you would have been able to think of an instance in your life where that happened.  We are all a mix of these 4 traits -- all 4 traits (being risky, being analytical, being committed, being nurturing) exist in all of us.  Today’s session, we’ll take a look at a way to describe different personality types that will help you think about collaboration.”

Talk about why learning to work with different work styles is or has been important to you. (application at work, understanding self, understanding others, being yourself while also meeting others where they are.)

# Why use COLORS as a tool?

* Simple and easy to apply
* Based on the same extensive research as Myers-Briggs (MBTI)
* Provides a common language for understanding ourselves and others at work

<!--
So why do we use True Colors as a tool? 

First, it’s easy to understand and apply. For those who have taken Myers-Briggs, you know it’s It’s complex!  This is quicker to grasp and easier to apply to ourselves and others in the workplace. In fact, Google’s engineering teams use Colors in leadership training. It’s a common language for discussion and learning within the company.

Also, it’s based on MBTI, which is extensively researched and has stood the test of time. 

It helps us better understand ourselves and others, which can save a lot of time and headache.
