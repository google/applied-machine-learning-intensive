# Data Exploration 

* Exploration to understand the data before starting ML modeling
* Techniques for data exploration include:
* Summary statistics
* Histogram
* Correlation diagram

<!--
* Once you get your hand on a dataset, the instinct is to jump in and start creating an ML model.  However, it’s critical that you have a good understanding of the data at hand to build a good quality ML model.
* Understanding the nature of the data can be done with various techniques and using different tools:
  * Start with basic techniques such as computing the summary statistics and creating histogram for each of columns of your data
  * If your data contains multiple columns, correlation charts might be useful
* Another topic which we will discuss in a future week is feature selection - that means selection which select set of your data will be used as input to your model.  Understanding the data will give insight on which subset of your data make up a good feature.

# Data Manipulation

* Most dataset are not clean
* Data exploration can surface issues with your dataset
* The data issues needs to be addressed by performing data manipulation
* Ensure the data is in a good shape for you ML modeling step

<!--
* For the purpose learning, we have been using a fairly clean dataset which minimal issues.  However, in the real world the dataset that you acquire will most likely be unclean.  Thus, as part of your data explorations - you’ll want to keep eye of data issues that you may have to address prior to starting your ML modeling.
* Examples of data issues:
  * Typos
  * Missing values in certain rows/columns
  * Wrong datatype, eg: string number “1”, instead of integer value 1
  * Valid data you may need to transform, eg: floating point numbers that need to be re-interpreted as TRUE when values is bigger than x, otherwise FALSE

<!--
Now, let’s apply what you’ve learned recently, such as Python, Pandas, and visualization libraries to help you explore and manipulate a dataset.
