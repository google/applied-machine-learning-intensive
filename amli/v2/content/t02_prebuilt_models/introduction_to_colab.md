# What is Colab?

* Colab is short for Google Colaboratory
* Free in-the-browser programming environment
* Require no setup, runs entirely on the Cloud
* Like Jupyter notebook that is stored in Google Drive
* Available at https://colab.research.google.com

# Colab Notebook

* Consists of cells which are either code or text cell
* Code cell contains your code and is executable to produce an output
* Code cell executions are performed by connecting to a cloud-based runtime
* Text cell contain explanatory text and images
* Text cells are formatted using using a simple markup language called markdown

<!--
The first time you execute a Colab’s code cell, Colab will connect to one of the available cloud-based runtimes.  Typically the runtime, support execution of Python code.  Other configuration of runtime allows the execution of TensorFlow projects, or access to GPU/TPU.

# Notebook Sharing

* Sharing a Colab notebook is as easy as sharing a Google Doc
* Can export the notebook to Github or download the file
* Downloaded file is compatible for use with Jupyter Notebook or compatible environments
* Use Seedbank to find shared Colab notebook 

<!--
Since a Colab notebook is stored in Google Drive, sharing a Colab notebook is as easy as sharing Google Doc.  Just like Google Doc sharing, you decide on the share permissions, eg: view-only or edit privilege.

If you prefer, you can export the notebook to Github repository or download the notebook as a file.  The downloaded file is written in standard Jupyter notebook format and can be use in Jupyter Notebook or other compatible framework

Seedbank is an example of search engine for Colab notebooks for material for exploration and learning of ML.
