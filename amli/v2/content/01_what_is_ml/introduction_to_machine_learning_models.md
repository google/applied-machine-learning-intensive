# What **can** Machine Learning do?

<!--
Start by asking students for suggestions of ML tasks and applications of them in everyday life. Ask which models they may know about.

Go through the next slides (up to slide 13) fairly quickly, which are closer looks at examples of machine learning problems and applications.

Then come back to this slide and split the class into groups of 3-4. Give a set of cards from the Intro to ML Models [GE] activity to each group with instructions. For advanced groups, give an extra challenge to think of examples of what ML *cannot* do. 

Spend ~10 minutes discussing. Once they finish, go back through the slides for each model type. Ask each group to give a brief explanation of the model in their own words, then list each task and their associated apps. Other groups compare their results and raise their hand if they have anything different. Let them discuss and figure out without help which answer is correct.

Highlight the importance of explaining their reasoning and coming to a conclusion as a group!

## Classification
Determine which class or category an example belongs to using labeled data as a guide

<!--
Classification systems determine which class or category an example belongs to. They can distinguish between two or more classes. These classes are defined based on your goals for the machine learning system.

For example, to answer the question, "Is this a lion?", you would choose the classes "yes" and "no" (the problem of choosing between two classes is also called “binary classification”). To answer the question, "What type of cat is this?", you might choose the classes "lion," "tiger," and "kitten."

<!--
This animation shows, mathematically, what a binary classification system is trying to do: given data points from two classes (blue and red), learn some mathematical function that can separate the two classes and predict which class a new data point is in.

The system can predict which class to apply to new data after training on existing data labeled with the correct class. 

Quick discussion: What are some other examples of a classification system that you can think of?
(very open ended, possible ex):
who is speaking right now?
identify objects in images
label emails as spam

## Clustering
Find relationships between data

<!--
Clustering looks for similar examples in a dataset. It is an example of unsupervised machine learning, or a system that does not require correct labels provided to learn. Instead, in the process of clustering, a machine learning system defines categories and places examples into each category by quantifying how closely examples are related to one another.

Clustering differs from classification because the categories are not defined by you. Clustering systems propose their own categories based on patterns found in the examples.

<!--
For example, let’s say the child from the zoo wants to organize a photo albums of many pictures from the zoo. They don’t know a lot about animals, but they do notice that some are very small (reptiles, birds), some are medium sized (monkeys, seals) and some are very big (elephants, tigers). They might sort the pictures into three groups based on size. 

Clustering systems similarly attempt to find “clusters” of similar data examples.

Quick discussion: What are other examples of clustering you can think of? What features might a clustering system use to create clusters?
(many possible answers, ex):
suggesting similar videos
grouping many examples of soft drinks from around the world

## Regression
Predicting the relationship between multiple variables

<!--
Regression predicts the relationship between two or more variables. If you were interested in predicting the price of a house, you might look for patterns in location, square footage, or number of bedrooms. While classification involves a discrete / categorical value to predict, regression involves a continuous value to predict.

<!--
This graphic shows one simple type of regression, which tries to find the best-fitting line for some data points, then makes predictions based on that line.

## Regression

<!--
Regression may also discover a more complicated pattern, such as this sine-like pattern of sea surface temperature every year.

Quick discussion: What are other examples of regression? What features might be useful for that regression system?
ex:
estimate arrival time based on traffic and distance
predict crop yield based on weather, time of year

## Sequences
Suggest the next value in a sequence

<!--
Finally, sequence prediction suggests what might come next, based on previous examples.

<!--
Autocomplete is an example of a sequence prediction: predicting what word is most likely to be entered after typing part of a phrase.

Quick discussion: what are some other examples of sequence predictions?
ex:
translations based on context
password strength (how predictable is the next letter from the previous ones)

# What **can't** Machine Learning do?

<!--
Machine learning is *not* magic, and ML is not a good fit for all problems. The principles underlying machine learning are not new but are possible today because of the amount of available public data and processing power. 

See if any groups thought of examples of what ML can’t do, or ask for examples of things you don’t need ML for.

There are problems for which ML is not a good or viable solution (for example, if you don’t have enough data or not enough diversity, ie, the data is so biased that you can’t generalize), and there are problems that ML actually cannot solve.

Good ML problems:
have a clear use case, 
reflect developers' solid understanding of the problem, 
use lots of historical data, 
and require decisions, not just predictions.

Some examples of current limitations of ML (from https://www.quora.com/What-can-machine-learning-do-and-cant-do):
an ML system cannot infer a context-free grammar that generates the strings in a language. In other words, an ML system can’t achieve true understanding of the grammar that generates a language the same way a human can
Similar to statistics or data science approaches, ML cannot be used to show cause-effect relationships

What attributes of a dataset would you consider ideal?

* Large size / High diversity
* Large size / Low diversity
* Small size / High diversity
* Small size / Low diversity

Does the ordering of the data matter? Why?

<!--
One important consideration is the quality of data -- machine learning models are only as good as the examples used to train them. 

Discuss: what attributes of a dataset would be ideal? (Correct answer is Large size / High diversity: A large number of examples that cover a variety of use cases is essential for a machine learning system to understand the underlying patterns in the data. A model trained on this type of dataset is more likely to perform well on new data.)

Even if you have a lot of data, if it does not cover a variety of examples, a model will have lower confidence for new data underrepresented in the training examples.
A small dataset with lots of variety makes it challenging to find patterns in the data. The predictions will lack the confidence a larger dataset provides. And if your dataset is small without much variation, you may not even need machine learning.

Discuss: Does ordering of the data matter? (Answer: Kind of)

Ordering of the data matters when you might have groups of highly correlated examples. For example, if you feed your ML system all pictures of lions, then all pictures of tigers, and so on, it may not be able to learn general patterns as well. It’s extremely important to shuffle the training data to avoid such groupings (though as long as you shuffle, the exact ordering after the shuffle does not matter).
