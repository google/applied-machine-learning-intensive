"""
The script should accept a git repository and Google Drive folder URL as
arguments

$ amli create-course \
$   https://github.com/google/applied-machine-learning-intensive \
$   https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bz9sbDA

The drive folder referenced is a folder created by the operator that will be
shared with an instructor who will be teaching an instance of the course. The
script will:
-   Scan the git repository for course materials.

-   Create sub-folders in the Google Drive folder for each track and unit in
    the repository.

-   For each unit:

    -   Open the unit metadata.json file.

    -   If there are IPython notebooks referenced in the metadata:

        -   Put a copy of each notebook in the appropriate unit folder after
            stripping out metadata such as "Concepts" blocks. This will be the
            instructor copy of the notebook.

        -   Change the notebook metadata in drive to ensure that the notebook
            opens in Colab.

        -   Create a second copy of each notebook in the appropriate unit
            folder. The second copy will be student copy of the notebook. The
            notebook should have all answer keys and concept blocks removed.

    -   If there are slides referenced in the metadata:

        -   Scan the slide markdown for links to colabs. If found, modify the
            link to reference the student version of the colab created earlier.

        -   Run those slides through ​md2googleslides​ to convert markdown to
            slide
        -   Put the Google Slides in the appropriate unit folder.

    -   If there are documents referenced in the metadata:

        -   Convert the markdown to a Google Doc and place it in the
            appropriate unit folder.
    -   Create a single course map document that links to all of the generated
        content for the course. This course map should exist at the top level
        of the Google Drive passed to the script.
