Part III: Comparing Happiness Data across Years
===============================================

We have two files of happiness data, one for 2017 that you have been using, and
another for `2012 <../_static/happiness_2012.csv>`_, so you can do some
comparisons across a span of five years.

1. Start a new workbook, and get each of the csv files for the happiness data
   loaded into a separate sheet.

2. Now, let's create a table on a new sheet that shows the happiness rank for
   each country for each year. You'll have 3 columns: country name, 2012 rank,
   and 2017 rank. (Hint: Use ``VLOOKUP``.) But wait! What is the deal with these
   ``#N/A`` values? Shouldn't the happiness report have the same countries for
   every year? Apparently, just like regular people, not all countries
   participated in the survey every year. Let's press on and hope for best for
   the moment.

Now, create a column where you calculate the change between the 2017 rank and
the 2012 rank. Then create a new cell where you find the maximum value of this
new column.

Oh dear, hoping for the best is rarely a good strategy. You will notice that the
result of looking for the maximum value in a column that contains one of these
``#N/A`` values results in the function returning ``#N/A`` as well. It appears
we will have to find a better strategy.

The right way to handle this problem is to use the ``IFERROR`` function. This is
one area where Google Sheets and Excel are slightly different. The ``IFERROR``
function takes two parameters: a function or calculation, and a value to insert
in the case of an error. In our case, we want to adjust our subtraction so that
if there is an error, we will set the difference to be 0. We'll change the
calculation to look something like ``=IFERROR(C2-P2, 0)``. Now, you will see
that wherever we had an ``#N/A`` value before, we now have a 0. You will also
see that we get interesting values for maximum and minimum.

   What is the name of the country with the largest positive change in their
   happiness rank? |blank| What about the largest negative change? |blank|

   - :Albania: Is the correct answer
     :x: Remember to use the MATCH and INDEX functions for this part

   - :Bulgaria: Is the correct answer
     :x: Remember to use the MATCH and INDEX functions for this part


3. Next, let's find the biggest changes in the happiness scores from 2012 to
2017.

.. mchoice:: act_mc_samechange

   Are the countries that with the largest change in rank the same as the
   countries with the largest change in score?

   - False

     + Surprisingly yes

   - True

     - No, the countries are different


.. fillintheblank:: act_fb_bigmoversscore

   What is the name of the country with the largest positive change in their
   happiness score? |blank| What about the largest negative change? |blank|

   - :Nepal: Is the correct answer
     :x: Remember to use the MATCH and INDEX functions for this part

   - :Ghana: Is the correct answer
     :x: Remember to use the MATCH and INDEX functions for this part


.. shortanswer:: act_why_diff

   Give an explanation for why you think the two are different. Outline an
   experiment or calculation that you can do with a spreadsheet to back up your
   answer.

4. For the five countries with the largest changes in ranking between 2012 and
   2017, what are the factors that changed the most? For this part, you can do
   this by making comparisons between sheets rather than creating a huge number
   of new columns on this summary sheet.


.. shortanswer:: act_big_factors

   What did you learn in the previous investigation? What were the factors that
   changed the most?


**Challenge**

5. The choropleth gave us some insight into how happiness may be related to the
   continent. It was pretty clear that African nations were less happy than many
   others. Let's see if we can quantify that.

   a. First, we need to find a file that helps us map from
      `country to continent <../_static/country_codes.csv>`_. Let's add this to
      our file as a new worksheet.

   b. How can we add a column (or a few columns) to our happiness spreadsheet
      from this spreadsheet? We can use ``VLOOKUP``.

   c. Once we have the continent name added to the spreadsheet, can we find the
      average happiness score for each continent?
