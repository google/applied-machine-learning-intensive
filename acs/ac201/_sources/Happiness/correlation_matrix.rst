Challenge:  Calculating a Correlation matrix
============================================

Early on in our exploration of the happiness data, we calculated the correlation
between the happiness score and the different factors. Now we have more data and
more factors to continue, and we might ask a more general question about which
of our columns are correlated with each other. A common way to do this is to
build a correlation matrix. The rows and the columns of the correlation matrix
represent each of our different factors and the individual values in the cells
of the matrix represent the correlation between each pair of factors.

The following table is an example of a correlation matrix. Suppose we have three
factors A, B, and C.

* A and B have a correlation of 0.7
* A and C have a correlation of -0.5
* B and C have a correlation of 0.9


.. csv-table::
    :header: ,A,B,C
    :stub-columns: 1

    A,1.0,0.7,-.5
    B,0.7,1.0,.9
    C,-.5,.9,1.0


Notice that the diagonal of this matrix has all values of 1.0. Each factor is
perfectly correlated with itself.

In the next steps, you will build a correlation matrix between the various
factors of our happiness data. This will challenge your use of the $ in defining
ranges as well as your ability to think about having several cells of a
spreadsheet work together.


1. To calculate a correlation matrix we will make use of sheets ``INDEX`` and
   ``CORREL`` functions.  The ``CORREL`` function expects two ranges: in our
   case, two columns of numbers to compute the correlation between. For example,
   the happiness score and the economy. However, to make our correlation matrix,
   we need to compute the correlation between all pairs of columns. Using the
   column letters is more compact so lets write out a few.

   a. EE, EF, EG, EH, EI, EJ, EK, EL, FE, FF, FG, FH, FI, FJ, FK, FL, ...

   b. Here is a Python snippet that should give you the full idea.

      .. code-block:: python

         for i in "EFGHIJKL":
             for j in "EFGHIJKL":
                 print("correlate column ", i, " with column ", j)

   c. The aptly named ``INDEX`` function is what allows us to do this by writing
      one clever function and then copying and pasting it to fill out our
      matrix.

2. It may take a bit of experimentation to get the indexes and the $ notation
   correct but you will eventually end up with a matrix where the diagonal is 1.
   This is a good indicator that you have things right.
   `This link <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc55cnr8A14>`_ may also be useful
   for getting this right.

3. Once you have the numbers, we can make a rough heat map by using conditional
   formatting. Using some conditional formatting rules, we can change the
   foreground and background color of the cells. Let's start by adding a rule
   that says if the correlation is between 0.75 and 1.0, then color the
   background green.

4. You can add other rules to cover different ranges, but you will immediately
   see which cells we might want to focus on the most.
