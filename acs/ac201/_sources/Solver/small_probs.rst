Small Problems To Try
=====================

1. With exactly 2700 square inches of cardboard, we wish to construct a box
   (width *2x*, depth *x*, height *2x*. We would like to maximize the volume *V*
   the box can hold. Which values of width, depth, and height fulfill our
   objective?

2. A cylindrical can is to hold 20m:sup:3. The material for the top and bottom
   costs $10/m:sup:2, and material for the side costs $8/m:sup:2. Find the
   radius *r* and height *h* of the most economical can.

3. A farmer wants to customize his fertilizer for his current crop. He can buy
   plant food mix A and plant food mix B. Each cubic yard of food A contains 20
   pounds of phosphoric acid, 30 pounds of nitrogen and 5 pounds of potash. Each
   cubic yard of food B contains 10 pounds of phosphoric acid, 30 pounds of
   nitrogen and 10 pounds of potash. He requires a minimum of 460 pounds of
   phosphoric acid, 9060 pounds of nitrogen and 220 pounds of potash. If food A
   costs $30 per cubic yard and food B costs $35 per cubic yard, how many cubic
   yards of each food should the farmer blend to meet the minimum chemical
   requirements at a minimal cost? What is this cost?

4. "Travelling salesman problem": Create a matrix of distances and then a row of
   nodes to go to and from. Use index to lookup the distance, and minimize the
   total distance.
