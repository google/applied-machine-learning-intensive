Preface
=======

It is said that the most important characteristic of a data scientist is
curiosity. Curiosity has certainly led me on a path of discovery throughout the
world of data science, and many fascinating data sets that I have encountered.
So, the premise of this book is to let the datasets lead you to learning. The
best and most interesting way to learn is to find some data and then begin to
ask questions about it, analyze it, visualize it, then write down new questions
that have occurred to you as you have been doing your initial analysis.

This is how I organized the first two data science courses I ever taught, and,
surprisingly it worked. In fact, it worked so well that I would never want to
teach it any other way. Nevertheless, it may not be clear, from a high level look
at the table of contents, what this course covers and the learning goals it
strives to achieve. So, let me lay it out for you in a different organization.
