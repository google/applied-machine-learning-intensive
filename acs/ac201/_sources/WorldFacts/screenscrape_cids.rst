Graphing Infant Mortality on a Map
==================================

Let's take on the seemingly simple task of plotting some of the country data on
a map, like we did in Google Sheets earlier. We'll see that this is one area
where things are not quite as simple as they are in Sheets. But we can make it
work with a bit of effort.

Altair provides us with the facility to make a blank map. But filling in the
data requires a bit more work on our part.

This is a good example of learning by example, then extrapolating what you need
to do based on understanding the example.

The counties data that is passed to the chart is the data needed to
create and outline the map.


.. code:: python3

   import altair as alt
   from vega_datasets import data
   counties = alt.topo_feature(data.us_10m.url, 'counties')
   unemp_data = data.unemployment.url


   alt.Chart(counties).mark_geoshape().project(
       type='albersUsa').properties(
       width=500,
       height=300
   )


.. image:: Figures/WorldFactbook_55_0.png


What about our encoding channels?! The primary data needed to draw the map using
a ``mark_geoshape`` was passed to the Chart, but that is really secondary data
for us. What we care about is graphing the unemployment data by county. That is
in a different data frame with a column called ``rate``.

With a geoshape, we can encode the county data using color. But, there is no
unemployment data in counties, so we have to use a ``transform_lookup`` to
**map** from the way counties are identified in the geo data to our DataFrame
that contains unemployment data.


.. code:: python3

   unemp_data = pd.read_csv('http://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/unemployment.tsv',sep='\t')
   unemp_data.head()


.. raw:: html

    <div style="max-width: 800px; overflow: scroll;">
    <style scoped>
        .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
            vertical-align: middle;
        }

        .dataframe tbody tr th {
            vertical-align: top;
        }

        .dataframe thead th {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>
    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
      <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
          <th></th>
          <th>id</th>
          <th>rate</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>0</th>
          <td>1001</td>
          <td>0.097</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>1</th>
          <td>1003</td>
          <td>0.091</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>2</th>
          <td>1005</td>
          <td>0.134</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>3</th>
          <td>1007</td>
          <td>0.121</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>4</th>
          <td>1009</td>
          <td>0.099</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    </div>


Using the ``transform_lookup`` method, we can arrange for the id in the
geographic data to be matched against the id in our ``unemp_data`` data frame.
This allows us to make use of two data frames in one graph. The example below is
a bit misleading, in that id is used both as the lookup, as well as the key in
the call to LookupData. The lookup value refers to the column name in the
DataFrame passed to Chart, where as the second parameter to the LookupData call
is the name of the column in the ``unemp_data`` DataFrame. It is just a
coincidence that they have the same name in this example.


.. code:: python3

   alt.Chart(counties).mark_geoshape(
   ).encode(
       color='rate:Q'
   ).transform_lookup(
       lookup='id',
       from_=alt.LookupData(unemp_data, 'id', ['rate'])
   ).project(
       type='albersUsa'
   ).properties(
       width=500,
       height=300,
       title='Unemployment by County'
   )

Using a Web API to get Country Codes
------------------------------------

Can you make use of the provided example and the altair documentation to produce
a graph of the world where the countries are colored by one of the features in
the data?

In this part of the project we will:

-  Learn about using web apis for data gathering
-  Use a web api to get data that maps country codes to country numbers
-  Learn how to add columns to a data frame using the ``map`` function, and
   possibly learn to use a lambda function if you've never used one before

Lets make a to-do list:

1. We need to add a column to our ``wd`` DataFrame that contains the numerical
   country id. Where can we get this data? There may be some CSV files with this
   information already in them, but this is a good chance to learn about a
   common technique used by data scientists everywhere: **web APIs**. API stands
   for Application Programmer Interface. Each website will have its own
   convention for how you ask it for data, and the format in which the data is
   returned.

2. Once we have the new column, we can follow the example from above to make a
  world map and show birthrate data.

The first step is to make use of the awesome
`requests module <http://http://docs.python-requests.org>`_. The requests module
allows us to easily communicate to databases across the web. The documentation
for it is fantastic, so you should use that to learn about requests in more
detail. We'll just give you the bare bones here to get started.

The website called ``restcountries.eu`` provides an interface for us to get data
from their site rather than a web page. When thinking about a web API, you have
to understand how to ask it for the data you want. In this case, we will use
``/rest/v2/alpha/XXX``. If we unpack that into pieces, let's look at what its
telling us.

* ``/rest``: Technically, REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. This
  uses the HTTP protocol to ask for and respond with data.
* ``/v2``: This is version 2 of this website's protocol.
* ``/alpha``: This tells the website that the next thing we are going to pass
  tell it is the three-letter code for the country.
* ``XXX``: This can be any valid three-letter country code, for example "usa".

Open a new tab in your browser and paste this URL:
`https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/usa`. You will see that you don't get a
web page in response, but rather some information that looks like a Python
dictionary. We'll explore that more below. We can do the same thing from a
Python program using the requests library.


.. code:: python3

   import requests
   res = requests.get('https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/alpha/usa')
   res.status_code


.. parsed-literal::

   200


The status code of 200 tells us that everything went fine. If you make a typo in
the URL, you may see the familiar status code of 404, meaning not found.

We can also look at the text that was returned.


.. code:: python3

   res.text


.. parsed-literal::

   '{"name":"United States of America","topLevelDomain":[".us"],"alpha2Code":"US","alpha3Code":"USA","callingCodes":["1"],"capital":"Washington, D.C.","altSpellings":["US","USA","United States of America"],"region":"Americas","subregion":"Northern America","population":323947000,"latlng":[38.0,-97.0],"demonym":"American","area":9629091.0,"gini":48.0,"timezones":["UTC-12:00","UTC-11:00","UTC-10:00","UTC-09:00","UTC-08:00","UTC-07:00","UTC-06:00","UTC-05:00","UTC-04:00","UTC+10:00","UTC+12:00"],"borders":["CAN","MEX"],"nativeName":"United States","numericCode":"840","currencies":[{"code":"USD","name":"United States dollar","symbol":"$"}],"languages":[{"iso639_1":"en","iso639_2":"eng","name":"English","nativeName":"English"}],"translations":{"de":"Vereinigte Staaten von Amerika","es":"Estados Unidos","fr":"États-Unis","ja":"アメリカ合衆国","it":"Stati Uniti D\'America","br":"Estados Unidos","pt":"Estados Unidos","nl":"Verenigde Staten","hr":"Sjedinjene Američke Države","fa":"ایالات متحده آمریکا"},"flag":"https://restcountries.eu/data/usa.svg","regionalBlocs":[{"acronym":"NAFTA","name":"North American Free Trade Agreement","otherAcronyms":[],"otherNames":["Tratado de Libre Comercio de América del Norte","Accord de Libre-échange Nord-Américain"]}],"cioc":"USA"}'


That looks like an ugly mess! Fortunately, it's not as bad as it seems. If you
look closely at the data, you will see that it starts with a ``{`` and ends with
a ``}``. In fact, you may realize this looks a lot like a Python dictionary! If
you thought that, you are correct. This is a big long string that represents a
Python dictionary. Better yet, we can convert this string into an actual Python
dictionary and then access the individual key-value pairs stored in the
dictionary using the usual Python syntax!

The official name for the format that we saw above is called JSON: JavaScript
Object Notation. It's a good acronym to know, but you don't have to know
anything about Javascript in order to make use of JSON.


.. code:: python3

   usa_info = res.json()

**Check Your Understanding**


.. fillintheblank:: fb_api1

   What is the numericCode for the country of Peru? |blank|

   - :(604|'604'): Is the correct answer
     :51: Is the callingCode for Peru, use that if you are phoning a friend
     :x: Check your answer again


.. fillintheblank:: fb_api2

   Copy and paste the list of the three letter country codes of the countries
   that border Peru. Do not include the square brackets. |blank|

   - :'BOL', 'BRA', 'CHL', 'COL', 'ECU': Is the correct answer
     :200: 200 is the status code of the request
     :x: There are five country codes, in single quotes separated ', '


.. fillintheblank:: fb_api3

   How many keys are in the dictionary returned for the country of Peru? |blank|

   - :24: Is the correct answer
     :x: Use the keys method after .json() to see the list of keys


Now that we have a really nice way to get the additional country information,
let's add the numeric country code as a new column in our ``wd`` DataFrame. We
can think of adding the column as a transformation of our three-letter country
code to a number. We can do this using the ``map`` function. You learned about
``map`` in the Python Review section of this book. If you need to refresh your
memory, see here :ref:`PythonReview`.

When we use Pandas, the difference is that we don't pass the list as a parameter
to ``map``. ``map`` is a method of a Series, so we use the syntax
``df.myColumn.map(function)``. This applies the function we pass as a parameter
to each element of the series and constructs a brand new series.

For our case, we need to write a function that takes a three-letter country code
as a parameter and returns the numeric code we lookup **converted to an
integer**, let's call it ``get_num_code``. You have all the details you need to
write this function. Once you write this function, you can use the code below.


.. code:: python3

   wd['CodeNum'] = wd.Code.map(get_num_code)
   wd.head()

.. warning:: DataFrame Gotcha

   Be careful, ``wd.CodeNum`` and ``wd['CodeNum']`` are ALMOST always
   interchangeable, except for when you create a new column. When you create a
   new column you MUST use ``wd['CodeNum'] = blah new column expression``. If
   you write ``wd.CodeNum = blah new column expression``, it will add a
   ``CodeNum`` attribute to the ``wd`` object, rather than creating a new
   column. This is consistent with standard Python syntax of allowing you to add
   an attribute on the fly to any object.

You can make a gray map of the world like this.


.. code:: python3

   countries = alt.topo_feature(data.world_110m.url, 'countries')

   alt.Chart(countries).mark_geoshape(
       fill='#666666',
       stroke='white'
   ).properties(
       width=750,
       height=450
   ).project('equirectangular')


So, now you have the information you need to use the example of the counties
above and apply that to the world below.


.. code:: python3

   base = alt.Chart(countries).mark_geoshape(
       fill='#666666',
       stroke='white'
   ).encode( #your code here

   ).transform_lookup( # your code here

   ).properties(
       width=750,
       height=450
   ).project('equirectangular')

   base

Using a Web API on Your Own
---------------------------

Find a web API that provides some numeric data that interests you. There is tons
of data available in the world of finance, sports, environment, travel, etc. A
great place to look is at
`The Programmable Web <https://www.programmableweb.com>`_. Yes, this assignment
is a bit vague and open-ended, but that is part of the excitement. You get to
find an API and graph some data that appeals to you, not something some author
or professor picked out. You might even feel like you have awesome superpowers
by the time you finish this project.

1. Use the web API to obtain the data. Most sites are going to provide it in
   JSON format similar to what we saw.

2. Next, create a graph of your using Altair.

3. Take some time to talk about and present the data and the graph you created
   to the class.
