Introduction
============

The World Factbook provides information on the history, people, government,
economy, geography, communications, transportation, military, and transnational
issues for 267 world entities. It is a rich source of information that can be
combined with many datasets. In fact, you used a form of this data in the World
Happiness project. In this module, we will explore the dataset in more depth,
and use Pandas to explore and visualize the data. The Factbook is in the public
domain. Accordingly, it may be copied freely without permission of the Central
Intelligence Agency.


Reading List
------------

   This is a great article to help you think about visualization.

-  `Getting Started with Altair <https://altair-viz.github.io/getting_started/starting.html>`_:
   Read the overview and then move to the
   `User Guide <https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/data.html>`_. Read this
   up to and including the section on data transformations.

As a warmup exercise (and maybe to stimulate some questions for investigation),
take the `Gapminder quiz <http://forms.gapminder.org/s3/test-2018>`_.

Let's start by loading some data about countries. This data has been compiled by
combining information from files at http://gsociology.icaap.org/dataupload.html.
We are going to use it to warm up our pandas skills. In this first part of the
module, we will continue with some data that should be familiar to you, but we
will use it in Pandas instead of a spreadsheet. In the second part, we will
focus on several different kinds of textual analysis using data from the United
Nations.

The goals for Part I of the module are:

-  Loading data into pandas
-  Using Altair to make some quick visualization of the data
-  Querying (filtering) our data
-  Sorting data
-  Adding new columns of data


Exploratory Questions to Get Started
------------------------------------

-  What are the minimum and maximum values of the data in each column?
-  How does the birth rate compare across countries? What is the distribution of
   the birth rates?
-  Is there are connection between the area of a country and its population?
-  How can we find all of the details on a specific country?
