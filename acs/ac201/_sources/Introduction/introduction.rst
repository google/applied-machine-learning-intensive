What Is Data Science?
=====================

`90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone.<http://www.iflscience.com/technology/how-much-data-does-the-world-generate-every-minute>`_
This is the result of the continuing acceleration of the rate at which we store
data. Some estimates indicate that roughly 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are
generated per day; that's 2,500,000,000,000,000,000 bytes! By comparison, all
the data in the Library of Congress adds up to about 200 TB, merely
200,000,000,000,000 bytes. This means that we are capturing 12,500 libraries of
congress per day!

The amount of data that Google alone stores in its servers is estimated to be 15
exabytes (15 followed by 18 zeros!). For those of you who remember punch cards,
you can visualize 15 exabytes as a
`pile of cards three miles high <https://what-if.xkcd.com/63/>`_ ,covering all
of New England. Everywhere you go, someone or something is collecting data about
you: what you buy, what you read, where you eat, where you stay, how and when
you travel, and so much more.


What does it all mean?
----------------------

Often, this data is collected and stored with little idea about how to use it,
because technology makes it so easy to capture. Other times, the data is
collected quite intentionally. The big question is: what does it all mean?
That's where data science comes in. Data science is an emerging field that
brings together ideas that have been around for years, or even centuries. Most
people define data science as "an interdisciplinary field about processes and
systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms".

Data science has spawned many new jobs in which people and computers extract
valuable insights from this data. These range from the simple scaling of
functions that existed previously, to completely new jobs processing data that
was never previously captured. For example, the owner of a general store 100
years ago kept a log, both on paper and in their head, of the items their
customers purchased and how those items varied with the seasons. Based on this
knowledge, they would decide how many of each product to order to meet their
customers' needs, while keeping their stock to a minimum. With data science,
this job can be done on the scale of thousands of supermarkets spread across the
country and can factor in a myriad of signals that would have been too hard for
the store owner to track, such as unemployment, inflation, or even weather
forecasts.

At the other end of the spectrum, we are now able to track the pressure applied
to various points on the sole of an athletic shoe with a precision that was
impossible just a few years ago. This allows manufacturers to design more
efficient and comfortable footwear

Data Science in a Liberal Arts Context
--------------------------------------

As an interdisciplinary field of inquiry, data science is perfect for a liberal
arts college. Combining statistics, computer science, writing, art, and ethics,
data science has application across the entire curriculum:  biology, economics,
management, English, history, music, pretty much everything. The best thing
about data science is that the job of a data scientist seems perfectly suited to
many liberal arts students.

  The best data scientists have one thing in common: unbelievable curiosity. - D.J. Patil Chief Data Scientist of the United States.

The diagram below is widely used to answer the question "What is Data Science?"
It also is a great illustration of the liberal arts nature of data science. Some
computer science, some statistics, and something from one of the many majors
available at a liberal arts college, all of which are looking for people with
data skills!

According to Eric Haller, VP of Experian (a global information services
company), recently interviewed by the Chicago Tribune:

  A data scientist is an explorer, scientist, and analyst all combined into one
  role. They have the curiosity and passion of an explorer for jumping into
  new problems, new datasets, and new technologies. They love going where no
  person has gone before in taking on a new approach to taking on age old
  challenges or coming up with an approach for a very new problem where nobody
  has tried to solve it in the past.

  They can write their own code and develop their own algorithms. They can keep
  up with the scientific breakthrough of the day and regularly apply them to
  their own work. And as an analyst, they have a penchant for detail,
  continually diving deeper to find answers. Finding treasure in the data,
  analysis, and the details give them an adrenaline rush.

  Our data scientists tend to operate with a noble purpose of trying to do good
  things for people, businesses and society with data.

However, all of this exploration and analysis means nothing if you cannot
communicate it to people. In a recent Harvard Business Review article by Jeff
Bladt and Bob Filbin entitled: **A Data Scientist's Real Job: Storytelling**,
they elaborate:

  Using Big Data successfully requires human translation and context whether
  it's for your staff or the people your organization is trying to reach.
  Without a human frame, like photos or words that make emotion salient, data
  will only confuse, and certainly won't lead to smart organizational behavior.
  - `Harvard Business Review <https://hbr.org/2013/03/a-data-scientists-real-job-sto/>`_

Stories are great, but in data science, you need to make sure they are true,
especially when you are dealing with stories about numbers. In a recent article
entitled
`The Ethical Data Scientist <http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/02/how_to_bring_better_ethics_to_data_science.html>`_,
the sub-title really tells the story: *People have too much trust in numbers to
be intrinsically objective*. The better known phrase is that "Statistics donâ€™t
lie, but statisticians sometimes do." The challenge for the data scientist is to
avoid the trap of choosing the statistics that only tell the story they want to
tell.

  The ethical data scientist would strive to improve the world, not repeat it.
  That would mean deploying tools to explicitly construct fair processes. As
  long as our world is not perfect, and as long as data is being collected on
  that world, we will not be building models that are improvements on our past
  unless we specifically set out to do so.


The Data Science Pipeline
-------------------------

.. image:: Figures/DSPipeline.svg
   :align: left


One of the primary goals of this course is to familiarize you with the data
science pipeline. That is the series of steps you will go through as you seek to
analyze and communicate with data. There are many steps in the pipeline and as
you can see; the pipeline is anything but a linear process. Doing data science
is a very iterative process whereby you will often repeat previous steps because
of something you learn in later steps. This is part of the exploratory nature of
data science. There is not a single formula for success, or a single process
that works for every data set. Let's look at each of the steps.

* **Get Data:** Acquiring data can come in many forms. Data is sometimes found
  in a simple file, or in relational database, from a web based interface, or in
  some unstructured form that you will scrape from a web page. Many times, a
  project will require data from more than one of these sources.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization (EDA):** It's virtually
  impossible to glance at a data set and comprehend what it is trying to tell
  you. So you need to spend some time exploring and getting to know the data.
  There are lots of questions you can ask about any data set that will help you
  in this task. What is the largest/smallest of X? What is the average of Y?
  What is the distribution of Z? In each module of this book, we will spend a
  good amount of time on the EDA task introducing you to these questions.

* **Data Cleaning:** As you explore the data, you will discover missing pieces,
  outliers, data that was entered incorrectly, or that is even of the wrong
  type. You will learn techniques for dealing with all of these problems.

* **Rescaling:** Sometimes, we want to look at data in its raw and unchanged
  form, but other times, having data that includes pricing data, along with age
  data, along with distance measurements can cause big problems. In these cases,
  we will learn ways to rescale the data so that it works with the algorithms we
  want to use.

* **Training / Test split:** In a machine learning project, we divide up our
  data into a training set that we will work with for model building, and a test
  set that we hold back and only use for test purposes. This is much more
  realistic because we frequently want to use our machine learning system to
  make predictions in new situations that we have never encountered. It is not
  very interesting to predict things that we already know.

* **Model Building:** Building models is an exciting part of data science. In
  this class, we will rely on libraries that are well tested rather than writing
  algorithms from scratch. In particular, we will use the amazing Scikit Learn
  library of models.

* **Model Testing:** Once the model is built, we need to test it to see how well
  it performs using our test data. Sometimes things work well, and sometimes we need to go back to the drawing board to build a completely different model using a completely different algorithm.

* **Polishing and Presenting:** Finally, when all is tested and validated, you
  will need to present your results. This may take the form of an infographic,
  an animated visualization, a video, a series of graphs that you narrate with
  text, or in a presentation. This is often the most important part of the
  process! It doesn't do anyone any good for you to spend weeks understanding
  what the data is telling you if you can't turn that into a form of
  communication that connects with your audience, whether it's your peers,
  your boss, your parents, or your customers.


Data Science in This Course
---------------------------

In this course, we will use the Python that you have already learned, and apply
those skills to the exploration of data about the world around us. The if
statements, for loops, and functions are still with us but, we will add some
specialized tools to allow us to process large datasets both easily and quickly.
These are the tools that researchers and professional data scientists use to
perform their work.

As we dive into data science, you will notice that the format of this course
will be very different from what you experienced in your Introduction to
Programming course. The questions that we will ask of each other and of the data
will be more open-ended. It is no longer a matter of only computing the mean or
median of some metric, but of exploring all the data available to us, sometimes
across multiple datasets, excluding outliers, and finding interesting groupings
or associations within them. This also means that, frequently, the answers to
these questions will not be a clear "yes" or "no", but something much more
subjective and open to analysis. That can be frustrating at times, but that is
reality of the messy world we live in (and the messy data we extract from it).

This means that the learning zones that we talked about
`previously <https://runestone.academy/runestone/static/fopp/FrontBackMatter/preface.html#get-in-the-learning-zone>`_
are still very much going to be with us. Computers are still very reliable, and
very quick, but not creative. As you apply more powerful tools to problem
solving, you will find that some things that might have been hard with basic
Python are now easy, allowing you to perform certain tasks in your comfort zone.
However, new tools also mean new ways for them to fail or produce unexpected
results. This will hopefully push you into your learning zone where you will
discover your ability to perform complex analyses to solve real-world problem.

There is a second definition of the learning zone that is related to what we
have been talking aobut. In this amazing
`TED talk: How to get better at the things you care about <https://www.ted.com/talks/eduardo_briceno_how_to_get_better_at_the_things_you_care_about>`_,
Eduardo BriceÃ±o talks about the "performance zone" versus the "learning zone."


.. youtube:: YKACzIrog24


The big takeaway for you is that as a student in the classroom for this class,
you are in the learning zone as BriceÃ±o defines it. You are not being judged or
graded for how quickly you arrive at an answer or not. The classroom for this
course is a time for you to practice old skills, try new skills, and to fail
without repercussions; that is how we learn! You will spend a huge amount of the
rest of your life in the performance zone, so take advantage of this opportunity
and enjoy the chance to be in the learning zone.

If you find yourself in the panic zone, please seek help from your instructor
and/or classmates. None of the activities in this book are intended to stump
you. As you understand how to solve some simpler problems, you will develop the
ability to join these solutions together to solve increasingly challenging
problems with real-world applications.


Datasets in this Book
---------------------

Every chapter in this book uses data. The data that we use is real world data
representing real world problems. This is far more interesting, and complex,
than the toy data sets you might find elsewhere. It also reminds you that
real-world examples are often messier than the carefully crafted examples you
might encounter in other courses or books.

When using real data, it is important to make sure that the data is licensed in
a way that is appropriate for your intended use. For example, the CIA World
Factbook data is licensed in the "public domain", which allows you to use the
data any way you want. You could even package the CIA data in an application for
a phone and sell that application on the app store. If you search, you will see
there is more than such app! Another data set called the Twitter US Airline
Sentiment data set is used in several different data science textbooks, and is
licensed using the Creative Commons
`CC-BY-NC-SA <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/>`_ license.
This license allows you to use the data, share the data, and adapt the data for
your own purposes as long as you give credit to the original source, share any
modifications you make to the data under the same license, and it restricts you
from using the data for commercial purposes (to make money). So you could not
use the airline tweet data in an app that charges users for airline
recommendations.

Since this textbook is educational, open source, and free, we believe that we
are not using the data for commercial purposes. So although we try to find
datasets that are in the public domain, or are
`CC-BY <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>`_ only, many interesting
data sets do have the non-commercial restriction. We will still use those
datasets, and we will point out their restrictions in each chapter as we explore
the data. In some cases, we've even gone the extra mile to seek out the
publisher of the data set and get explicit permission to use the data.

This book itself is licensed
`CC-BY-SA <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>`_. That means other
instructors or authors are free to take this book as a starting point, add new
material, change the examples we use if they want, remove material that isn't
relevant, as long as they give us credit as the original source, and license
their version of the textbook using the CC-BY-SA license. It also means that
this book is freely available for you and anyone else who wants to read it,
without paying for it.

Copyright laws are complicated, so please don't take anything written above as
legal advice. You can learn more about copyright law and the creative commons

How to Use This Book
--------------------

This book is designed to be used in conjunction with external tools like Google
Sheets and Jupyter Notebooks. You will need to move back and forth between
browser tabs as you work with the tools, and follow the instructions in the
book. You will be asked to answer the questions in the book as you read. This is
to encourage you to type in the code we have provided and experiment with it.
Learning computer science or data science is not a spectator sport. Many
students make the mistake of thinking that they can just read about it and
understand it. You really have to do it in order to understand it. So, don't
fool yourself and don't guess at the answers to the questions in the book.

Everything you learn in this class builds on and reinforces the things you have
learned previously. If you do fall behind, make sure you talk to your instructor
so you can develop a strategy for catching up.
