Finding the Cheaters
====================

In this lesson, you are going to do a simplified version of the analysis
outlined in the The Tennis Racket article. I have prepared an anonymized data
file for you that contains a numeric identifier instead of a name, along with
the starting odds and the ending odds of a number of tennis matches. Your goal
is to identify the cheaters. You can get the data from
`puzzle_anon.csv <../_static/puzzle_anon.csv>`_.


.. mchoice:: mc_ethics_anon_cheaters
   :random:

   Check the ids of all of the cheaters here.

   - 7002589994262270000

     + Cheater number 1

   - 2416068425895370000

     + Cheater number 2

   - 1547483661413490000

     + Cheater number 3

   - 6228119144908420000

     + Cheater number 4

   - 1718561694846000000

     + Cheater number 5

   - 4643766977283540000

     - You accuse an innocent person

   - 1693568023468290000

     - You accuse an innocent person

   - All are cheaters

     - No, not everyone is a cheater

   - All are honest

     - No, not everyone is honest


Now that you have identified the cheaters, can you match the cheaters with their
real names.
`Here is a dataset that contains their names <../_static/puzzle_real.csv>`_.

   Match the numeric identifiers from the first part of the project with the
   real names.
