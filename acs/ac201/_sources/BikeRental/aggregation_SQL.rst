Aggregation or Group By
=======================

One very powerful feature of SQL is that it allows us to create summary
information by grouping rows together. For example, we could ask
ourselves how many bike trips were taken for each subscriber type, and
which subscriber type has the most bike trips.


.. code:: python3

    %%sql
    SELECT
      member_type,
      COUNT(*)
    FROM
      trip_data
    GROUP BY
      member_type
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 10


.. parsed-literal::

     * sqlite:///bikeshare.db
    Done.


.. raw:: html

    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>member_type</th>
            <th>COUNT(*)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Member</td>
            <td>979814</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Casual</td>
            <td>246949</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unknown</td>
            <td>4</td>
        </tr>
    </table>


``GROUP BY member_type`` takes all the rows with a given
member_type and produces a single row in the result. This means that
we need to tell SQL how we want to combine the other columns' values
into a single row. The above example uses ``COUNT(*)``, which reports the number
of rows that were combined.

Aggregating the values for ``member_type`` is not hard, since
they're all the same; SQL just gives us a single copy of the publisher
name. As for the other columns, we need to either ignore them (causing them to
be omitted from the output) or specify a way to aggregate them.

We must specify an aggregate function for any column that we ``SELECT``
in our query (except the columns that we're grouping by) in order for the
command to run. If we don't specify a way to aggregate these columns, most
database servers will complain. However, SQLITE does not. SQLite lets you do
error-prone things without giving you an error. For example, the following query
will work, but you have no idea what the results actually mean.


.. code:: python3

    %%sql

    SELECT
      duration,
      COUNT(*)
    FROM
      trip_data
    GROUP BY
      member_type
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(*) DESC


.. raw:: html

    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
        <th></th>
        <th>duration</th>
        <th>COUNT(*)</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>3548</td>
        <td>979814</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>346</td>
        <td>246949</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>501</td>
        <td>4</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


Here you have grouped by ``member_type``, but without ``member_type`` in the
``SELECT`` clause, you have no idea which rows correspond to which member type.
That is why most databases will flag this as an error. Furthermore, the
duration field may be the first duration in the group, the last duration in the
group, or possibly in between; it is not defined. The best practices for writing
``GROUP BY`` queries are as follows.

* Always include the ``GROUP BY`` column(s) in your SELECT clause.
* If you include a column that is **not** in the ``GROUP BY`` clause in your
  ``SELECT`` clause, it must be in an aggregating function, for example ``MIN``,
  ``MAX``, ``MEAN``, ``COUNT``, etc.

Let's return briefly to the first query in this section. The
top result was the count of bike trips for member_type ``Member``.

=========== ========
member_type COUNT(*)
=========== ========
Member      979814
=========== ========

If you'd like to get a more granular break down of the count, you can
specify multiple columns to aggregate within the ``GROUP BY`` clause,
for example you can group by the member type and the start station.


.. code:: python3

    %%sql

    SELECT
      member_type,
      start_station,
      COUNT(*)
    FROM
      trip_data
    WHERE
      member_type = 'Casual'
    GROUP BY
      member_type,
      start_station
    ORDER BY
      COUNT(*) DESC
    LIMIT 20

Now that you're familiar with how to aggregate data using SQL
query by using ``COUNT()`` as your aggregation function, let's take a
look at other aggregation functions.

There are `many such
functions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/functions-aggregate.html>`__.
Some common ones include:

-  ``SUM``: To add the values together
-  ``AVG``: To compute the mean of the values
-  ``MIN`` or ``MAX``: To compute the minimum and maximum respectively

So we could, for example, compute the **total** number of minutes of all
bike trips for all subscriber types.


.. code:: python3

    %%sql

    SELECT
      member_type,
      SUM(duration)
    FROM
      trip_data
    GROUP BY
      member_type
    LIMIT 10

        <tr>
            <th>member_type</th>
            <th>SUM(duration)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Casual</td>
            <td>687530197</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Member</td>
            <td>759503541</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unknown</td>
            <td>3434</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
