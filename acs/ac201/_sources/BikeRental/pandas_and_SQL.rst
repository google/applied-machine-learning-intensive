Getting SQL Data into a DataFrame
=================================

Running the kind of queries we did in the last few sections is great for
exploring and getting to know the data. It is also useful if you just need a
one-time quick answer. But more often than not, what you want to do is to get
the data from a database into a DataFrame so that you can visualize it, combine
it with other data, or do further analysis. For this exercise our goal is to
create a Google Map with a marker for all of the stations in the database.

Pandas provides us with a great way to use our SQL knowledge to create create a
DataFrame with the results of a SQL query. The ``pd.read_sql`` function allows
us to pass in a SQL query as a string, along with a URL to connect to the
database, and returns a pandas DataFrame. Let's try that on our
bikeshare_stations table now.


.. code:: python3

    import pandas as pd
    stations = pd.read_sql_query("""
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        bikeshare_stations
      WHERE
        latitude IS NOT NULL
      """, 'sqlite:///bikeshare.db')
    stations.head()


.. raw:: html

    <table border="1" class="dataframe">
    <thead>
        <tr style="text-align: right;">
        <th></th>
        <th>index</th>
        <th>station_id</th>
        <th>name</th>
        <th>status</th>
        <th>latitude</th>
        <th>longitude</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th>0</th>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>31620</td>
        <td>5th &amp; F St NW</td>
        <td>open</td>
        <td>38.897637</td>
        <td>-77.018126</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>1</th>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>31105</td>
        <td>14th &amp; Harvard St NW</td>
        <td>open</td>
        <td>38.926638</td>
        <td>-77.032126</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>2</th>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>31400</td>
        <td>Georgia &amp; New Hampshire Ave NW</td>
        <td>closed</td>
        <td>38.935638</td>
        <td>-77.024126</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>3</th>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>31111</td>
        <td>10th &amp; U St NW</td>
        <td>open</td>
        <td>38.917638</td>
        <td>-77.025126</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th>4</th>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>31104</td>
        <td>Adams Mill &amp; Columbia Rd NW</td>
        <td>open</td>
        <td>38.922638</td>
        <td>-77.042126</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>


We can use any SQL query we want and pandas is 'smart' enough to look at the
results and create columns that match the columns in the database. If we know we
are going to have columns containing dates, it's a good idea to use the
``parse_dates`` parameter when we call ``read_sql_query``. This will ensure that
our date columns are of the correct type without us having to convert them
later.

Create a DataFrame of the first 10 rides from the trip_data table sorted by
``start_date``. Then add a column called ``calc_duration`` where you calculate
the duration of the ride by subtracting the start date from the end date.


.. fillintheblank:: bikes_dur_type

   What is the type of the ``calc_duration`` field that you just computed?
   |blank|

   - :.*imedelta.*: Is the correct answer
     :datetime64: Is the type for start_date and end_date but not for this column.
     :x: Make sure that you use the parse_dates parameter when you read the DataFrame


.. fillintheblank:: bikes_duration_readsql

   Paste the value for the first row here |blank| and the last row here |blank|.

   - :00\:59\:08: Is the correct answer
     :3548: Is the answer in seconds, calculate a new field
     :x: Keep working

   - :00.07.22: Is the correct answer
     :442: Is the answer in seconds, calculate a new field
     :x: Keep working


Mapping Bike Stations
---------------------

Now let's have some fun. We are going to map the location of all of the bike
stations on a Google Map! Later you can explore all kinds of ways to visualize
rides and ride frequencies routes between starting and ending point and many
more things.

To map our stations, we will use the ``gmaps`` module. You will need to
``conda install gmaps`` to install this. You will also need to install the
`jupyter-gmaps extension <https://github.com/pbugnion/gmaps#installing-jupyter-gmaps-for-jupyterlab>`_
for Jupyterlab. When you have followed the directions there, you will need to
use the exentions manager to install the ``jupyter-gmaps`` extension. The
instructions give you a link to the directions on how you can get your own API
key to use Google Maps in a notebook. Your instructor may also be able to
provide you with an API key as well. Don't worry, the installation is probably
the hardest part!

Let's proceed under the assumption that you have all of the prerequisites
installed and working. Our next task is to create a list of all the latitude and
longitude values for each of the bikeshare stations. The challenge here is that
the Google Maps interface wants to get a list of that looks like this:
``[(lat1, long1), (lat2, long2), ...]``. That means that we need to combine the
two columns from the DataFrame into a list of tuples. You could, of course, do
this with a ``for`` loop, iterating over all the rows and making a tuple, but
there is a much easier way.

Suppose we have the following two lists.


.. code:: python3

    list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]


Now, we want to combine these into ``[('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]``. We can do
that using Python's ``zip`` function: ``zip(list1, list2)``. The ``zip``
function takes any number of iterable objects and "zips" them together making a
tuple from the first element from each, then the second element of each etc. If
we now had three lists, ``zip`` would create tuples with three elements each.


.. code:: python3

    list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
    list2 = [1, 2, 3]
    str1 = "XYZ"


``list(zip(list1, list2, str1))`` returns
``[('a', 1, 'X'), ('b', 2, 'Y'), ('c', 3, 'Z')]``.

You might be thinking, why do we need to wrap ``zip`` with ``list``?  Well,
``zip`` does not actually return a list, ``zip`` returns an iterator that in
most circumstances behaves just like a list, except when you want to see a small
example.

The good news is that Series are also iterables so we can pass a series to the
``zip`` function and it will work great.


.. code:: python3

    import gmaps
    gmaps.configure(api_key='YOUR KEY HERE')


This gets everything set up to use ``gmaps``. Now let's use the stations
DataFrame we created earlier to make our first map.


.. code:: python3

    locations = list(zip(stations.latitude, stations.longitude))
    dc_center = (38.9072, -77.0369)
    fig = gmaps.figure(center=dc_center, zoom_level=12)

    marker_layer = gmaps.marker_layer(locations)
    fig.add_layer(marker_layer)
    fig


.. image:: Figures/map.png


Practice and Further Exploration
--------------------------------

1. The map seems a little busy with all those markers. Redo the map so that it
   only shows the 20 busiest stations. That is the 20 stations with the highest
   starting counts.

2. It would also be interesting to add the 20 stations with the largest ending
   counts. Can you add those in a different color?

3. Investigate the interface to see if there is a way for you to color-code the
   markers based on the number of rides originating from that station. Show the
   50 most popular stations using five different colors (1 color for the top 10,
   another for the next 10 and so on).

4. Bikeshare datasets are available for many cities. Most of them come in a
   similar format to this one. Find some bikeshare data for a city close to you
   or for your favorite city, and see if you can reproduce this map. Hint: if
   your data does not come with latitude and longitude, then investigate the
   ``geopy`` package. You can use your Google API or a free service like
   GeocodeFarm to use the address of the station to get the latitude and
   longitude.

5. This is a real **challenge** for you: pick a station and then follow the
   rentals, but only map the stations where a bike ends up back at your original
   starting point. In other words, map the bikes that started at station A, go
   to station B, then D then pause for a while then on to station X and finally,
   back to station A. Others may take a different route. If you can do this, you
   can investigate the layer that lets you add a route to the map! Then you can
   show the routes that the various bikes took to make their way back to the
   starting point. You may want to limit the time on this to one day or one
   week.

6. **Research Challenge** The ``gmaps`` interface allows you to add a heatmap
   layer. This sounds like it could a very interesting way to overlay the
   popularity of different stations and routes on the map. Investigate this
   layer and what the data should look like, then see if you can find a way to
   get the data into the appropriate form to make a heatmap.
