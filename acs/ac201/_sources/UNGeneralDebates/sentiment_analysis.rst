Sentiment Analysis of UN Speeches
=================================

Sentiment analysis is a probabilistic evaluation of a piece of text that
classifies the text as either positive, negative, or neutral. This kind of
analysis is really useful in today's online world, where everyone tweets their
opinion, or complaint, or love for a movie or restaurant or an airline. Whatever
the topic may be, people are constantly sharing their opinion. If you are a
marketing person, or a movie producer, or a restauranteur, you want to know what
people think of your product.

We'll give you a bit of background on how this classification works, and then
we'll use a popular Python package called ``nltk`` to produce a sentiment score
for each speech.


Naive Bayes
-----------

This is a very old technique that comes from the 1600's, but is emerging as a
very important bit of mathematics in the world of machine learning. It was the
first and primary algorithm to be used in classifying email messages as spam or
non-spam. The beauty of this algorithm is that it is reasonably understandable,
and is well within your reach as a programming project.

For now,
`this introduction <https://towardsdatascience.com/cat-or-dog-introduction-to-naive-bayes-c507f1a6d1a8>`_
is a good starting point.


Using NLTK to Score the Speeches
--------------------------------

The Natural Language ToolKit (`NLTK <https://www.nltk.org/>`_) provides us with
many tools for working with text and natural language sentences. NLTK provides a
couple of different algorithms for sentiment analysis: a NaiveBayes classifier
like we described above, and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment
Reasoner, not Darth Vader). VADER performs better on normal text and does not
require us to manually train a model. So, we will use Vader as it gets us going
a lot quicker.

To get started with Vader, we will need a download the data files Vader uses.


.. code-block:: python3

   import nltk
   nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
   nltk.download('punkt')


Here is a function that we can use to map each of the speeches to a sentiment
score.


.. code-block:: python3

   from nltk import tokenize
   from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
   analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

   def score_text(text):
       sentence_list = tokenize.sent_tokenize(text)
       cscore = 0.0
       for sent in sentence_list:
           ss = analyzer.polarity_scores(sent)['compound']
           cscore += ss
       return cscore / len(sentence_list)


Let's try it out on a couple of sentences to see what we get.
``score_text("This movie is horrible")`` gives us a values of -0.5423 while
``score_text("I love cute puppies")`` gives a score of 0.802. In fact, the
scores will always range from -1.0 to +1.0, where -1 is the most negative
sentiment and +1 is the most positive sentiment.

With our analyzer ready to go, we can add a column to the ``undf`` DataFrame
containing the sentiment score as follows.


.. code:: python3

   undf['sentiment'] = undf.text.map(lambda t : score_text(t))


You can start that line running in your notebook and grab a cup of coffee; it
will take a bit of time to run.

Now comes the moment of truth; let's see the distribution of sentiment scores
for all of the speeches.


.. code:: python3

   alt.Chart(undf).mark_bar().encode(x=X('sentiment', bin=True), y='count()')


.. figure:: Figures/sentiment_dist.png


Well, it seems that the vast majority of the speeches are neutral to positive.
But that may not be a big surprise, as you might expect that in the general
assembly, everyone tries to be careful and diplomatic with their speeches.

What is more interesting to investigate further are the speeches on the edges.


Questions for Investigation
---------------------------

* Which countries are the most positive or negative in their speeches throughout
  the years?
* Are there trends in positivity or negativity of speeches throughout the years?
* What are the main topics of the most negative speeches?
* What are the main topics of the most positive speeches?
