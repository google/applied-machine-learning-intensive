Working with Text
-----------------

The ``Series`` and ``index`` objects in Pandas each have a set of string
processing methods that make all of the standard Python string methods more
available to work on all of the string elements in a Series. We call these
"vectorized string methods", because Pandas is designed to allow these
operations to happen in parallel on all the rows of the data frame
simultaneously, if you have the computing power. These are accessed through an
intermediate object called ``str``. For example, suppose we wanted to convert
all of our three letter country codes to lowercase.


.. code:: python3

   undf.country.str.lower()


The code above does the job, and is over 700 times faster than using a for loop.

Here is a complete list of the string functions that the ``str`` object knows.
Most of them should be very familiar to you.

* ``len()``
* ``lower()``
* ``translate()`` - This one is a bit complicated,
  `see here <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/string_translate.htm>`_.
* ``islower()``
* ``ljust()``
* ``upper()``
* ``startswith()``
* ``isupper()``
* ``rjust()``
* ``find()``
* ``endswith()``
* ``isnumeric()``
* ``center()``
* ``rfind()``
* ``isalnum()``
* ``isdecimal()``
* ``zfill()`` - To add leading zeros to strings.
* ``index()``
* ``isalpha()``
* ``split()``
* ``strip()``
* ``rindex()``
* ``isdigit()``
* ``rsplit()``
* ``rstrip()``
* ``capitalize()``
* ``isspace()``
* ``partition()`` - To split each string into 3 parts the string before the
  separator, the separator, the string after the separator. This returns a data
  frame with three columns. For example, if your string is "Peter, Paul, and
  Mary", then partitioning it on "and" would return
  ["Peter, Paul", "and", "Mary"].
* ``lstrip()``
* ``swapcase()``
* ``istitle()``
* ``rpartition()`` - This is the same as ``partition``, but looks for the
  separator from right to left instead of left to right.


.. fillintheblank:: fb_un_count1

   How many rows from the United Nations dataset have a country code that starts
   with 'M'? |blank|

   - :663: Is the correct answer
     :18: Is the number of unique countries
     :x: You should use the startswith method on the series of country codes


.. fillintheblank:: fb_un_count2

   How many **country codes** from the United Nations dataset have a country
   code that starts with 'M'? |blank|

   - :18: Is the correct answer
     :663: Is the number of rows
     :x: Remember that Pandas has a unique method that removes duplicates


Below are some regular expression methods for strings.

* ``match()`` - Returns True/False if the string matches.
* ``extract()``
* ``extractall()``
* ``findall()``
* ``replace()``
* ``contains()``
* ``count()``
* ``split()``
* ``rsplit()``


.. fillintheblank:: fn_un_extract1

   What is the most common word that follows 'global' |blank| in all of the
   speeches and how many times does that word occur? |blank|


   - :economic: Is the correct answer
     :negotiations: You need to capture all occurrences using ``extractall``
     :warming: nice guess, but not there
     :economy: The correct answer is very similar
     :x: catchall feedback

   - :1033: Is the correct answer
     :256: make sure you use extractall


We can use our new skills to do a bit of minor cleanup on the text. Many of the
speeches start with an invisible non-breaking space character followed by a
newline. (You will see it as ``\n`` in the text.) We can eliminate this with the
following piece of code.


.. code:: python3

   undf['text'] = undf.text.str.replace('\ufeff','') # remove strange character
   undf['text'] = undf.text.str.strip() # eliminate whitespace from beginning and end


Research Questions
------------------

1.  What is the average word count per speech?
2.  How does that average compare across all of the countries?
3.  What is the average sentence length per speech?
4.  Find or create a list of topics that the UN might discuss and debate. Make a
    graph to show how often these topics were mentioned. For example:
    'peace', 'nuclear war', 'terrorism', 'moon landing'. You can think of your
    own!
5.  The five permanent members of the UN security council are
    ``sec_council = [‘USA’, ‘RUS’, ‘GBR’, ‘FRA’, ‘CHN’]``. Make a graph of the
    frequency of topics and how often they are discussed by those countries. You
    could do this same exercise with any group of countries. Maybe the central
    European, or North African, etc.
6.  Make a graph to show the frequency with which various topics are discussed
    over the years. For example, 'peace' is consistently a popular word as is
    'freedom' and 'human rights'. What about 'HIV' or 'terrorism' or 'global
    warming'. Compare two phrases like 'global warming' and 'climate change'.
7.  When did the internet become a popular topic?


Text Complexity
---------------

For years, people have been trying to find measures of text complexity,
sometimes to determine what 'reading level' an article is at, or how much formal
education is required to understand an piece of writing. These measures are
often functions of things such as the number of sentences in a paragraph,
sentence length, word length, number of polysyllabic words used, etc.

There are several Python packages that automatically compute the complexity for
you, so that you don't have to write that part yourself. One easy to use package
is called `textatistic <http://www.erinhengel.com/software/textatistic/>`_. It
calculates several different common measures of text complexity.

8.  Using the Gunning Fog or smog index, compute the reading complexity for each
    speech.
9.  Is there any correlation between the Fog index for a country and
    the GDP or literacy rate?
10. Make a graph showing the distribution of each of the above measures.
