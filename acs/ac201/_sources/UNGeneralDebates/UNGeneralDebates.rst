In this chapter, we are going to explore the text from many speeches over many
years given by delegates to the United Nations General Assembly. Every year
since 1947, representatives of UN member states gather at the annual sessions of
the United Nations General Assembly. The centrepiece of each session is the
General Debate. This is a forum at which leaders and other senior officials
deliver statements that present their government's perspective on the major
issues in world politics. (Jankin Mikhaylov, Slava; Baturo, Alexander; Dasandi,
Niheer, 2017, "United Nations General Debate Corpus",

This diversity of text gives us a great opportunity for some deeper exploration
of text. You can download

As you can see, the data frame is relatively simple. It consists of a session
number, year, country code and text. Most of the text is hidden because Pandas
doesn't want to make the notebook with unreadably long text strings. In reality,
most of the texts are very lengthy! If you want to see the entire string, you
can update Jupyterâ€™s ``max_colwidth`` option to see it all. You'll probably want
to set it back because, as you can see in the following example, looking at the
entire thing is largely useless.


.. code:: python3

   pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', -1)
   print(undf[(undf.year == 1970) & (undf.country == 'USA')].text)

   161    1.\t It is my privilege to extend to you once again the warm
   congratulations of the United States delegation on your election to the
   Presidency of the twenty-fifth session of the General Assembly. Your country
   has few peers in the contributions it has made to the work of this
   Organization. Your father was a leader in the League of Nations, and now, in
   this session of the General Assembly, you are adding a new chapter in the
   family tradition. In the United Nations community we have long known you as
   an able spokesman of your country, as a participant in the life of the
   United Nations from its very beginning and an authority on the Charter, as a
   leading scholar and practitioner in international law, and as one whose
   personal outlook is strongly humanitarian and imbued with hope and
   determination for a better future. We are indeed fortunate to have you to
   lead us in this session devoted to the strengthening and improvement of the
   United Nations.\n2.\tDuring this session we shall commemorate with fitting
   ceremony one of the most creative and hopeful events of this century, the
   founding of the United Nations twenty-five years ago. It is right that this
   commemoration should be held. It is far more important, however, that the
   nations gathered at this session should so act together as to strengthen the
   United Nations for the future, to ensure that we are closer to 'peace,
   justice and progress' five, ten and twenty- five years hence than we are
   today. The world is unlikely to care much what we say about the past. It
   will care a great deal what we do about the future.\n3.\tThe problems the
   world faces today are no less grave than those it faced twenty-five years
   ago. Indeed they are in many respects far graver. Unless and until the
   Members of the United Nations demonstrate their willingness to deal
   effectively with these problems, the confidence of the world's peoples in
   the United Nations will remain uncertain and precarious.\n4.\tIn the view of
   the United States, the most critical international problem today is the same
   as that which faced the founders of the United Nations: the need to build a
   reliable framework for peace and security among nations. As President Nixon
   said in this Assembly a year ago: '... there is no nobler destiny, nor any
   greater gift that one age could make to the ages that follow, than to forge
   the key to a lasting peace'. [1755th meeting, para. 45.]\n5.\tIn this
   conviction the United States has sought in the last two years to frame
   foreign policies which would help to make the international scene less
   destructively competitive, less strident, more cooperative and orderly. We
   have sought, in the spirit of the Charter, to pursue peaceful settlement of
   all conflicts and confrontations, and we have urged others to do
   likewise.\n6.\tThe most significant of these efforts has been the strategic
   arms limitation discussions between my country and the Soviet Union. If at
   last we can check the nuclear arms race, the world will have been helped to
   move away from its gravest danger and toward new and more rational
   relationships.\n7.\tThe United States also seeks, through a process of
   serious negotiation, to ease the tensions that arise from the division of
   Europe. We have welcomed the efforts of the Federal Republic of Germany to
   normalize relations with its eastern neighbors; we are seeking in fourPower
   talks to assure the security and wellbeing of the residents of Berlin; we
   have joined our NATO allies in proposing exploratory talks on the reduction
   of forces in central Europe. We hope these efforts will find the Soviet
   Union and its allies forthcoming.\n8.\tIn VietNam, over eighteen months ago,
   the United States reversed the trend in American involvement in the war. We
   began a steady, uninterrupted reduction in the number of our troops. We have
   made a negotiated peace our highest priority. Although North VietNam has as
   yet shown no serious intention to negotiate a solution under which the South
   VietNamese people can freely decide their own future, this remains our goal
   and we shall not be discouraged in seeking it.\nA/PV.1854\n9.\tMy Government
   has likewise sought ways to move toward a constructive relationship with
   mainland China. To this end, we have taken a number of unilateral steps to
   ease tensions. We are ready at any time to resume the talks in
   Warsaw.\n10.\tFinally, nowhere in the world today is there more urgent need
   to move from confrontation to negotiation than in the Middle East. The
   legacy of bitterness, hatred and suspicion there contains the seeds of even
   greater tragedy not only for the Middle East but for the world, unless there
   is early progress toward reconciliation and peace based on the legitimate
   interests of all the States and peoples of the region.\n11.\tAs the United
   Nations community well knows, the United States has made major diplomatic
   efforts in recent months and weeks to help bring about peace at long last in
   the Middle East. While recent developments in the area, including the tragic
   death of President Nasser, have cast a shadow over the high hopes of just a
   few weeks ago that a beginning toward that goal had been made, those hopes
   have not been extinguished. For the most part, the guns remain silent along
   the ceasefire lines. Security Council resolution 242 (1967) stands as a
   beacon pointing the way to peace, and the parties concerned, in accepting
   the United States initiative of June, have committed themselves to carry out
   that resolution in all its parts. Ambassador Jarring is ready to resume his
   mission whenever conditions permit. We earnestly hope that the parties
   themselves and all others concerned will now bend every effort to the task
   of building on the beginning that has already been made.\n12.\tThis will
   require above all serious steps to restore and strengthen confidence in the
   integrity of the ceasefire and military standstill agreement along the Suez
   Canal. It will also require, if negotiations are to move forward, a
   willingness by the parties to move from their maximum positions on the
   elements of a realistic and equitable peace settlement. In this spirit, my
   Government is prepared to contribute to renewed efforts toward peace in the
   Middle East.\n13.\tIn this anniversary year the United States, like many
   other Members, has given especially careful thought to means by which the
   United Nations can be better enabled to fulfill its purposes.\n14.\tMy
   delegation has listened, and will continue to listen attentively, to the
   suggestions of others in this regard. In the same spirit the United States
   will offer proposals, or support the proposals of others, with these
   objectives among others: first, to put United Nations peacekeeping
   operations on a firmer and more reliable basis; second, to make the United
   Nations more effective in the peaceful settlement of disputes; third, to
   promote new steps in the field of disarmament; fourth, to move closer by
   peaceful means to the goals of decolonization and human equality; fifth, to
   support the Second Development Decade; sixth, to help slow down too rapid
   rates of population growth; seventh, to promote the exploitation of the
   seabeds and outer space for human benefit; eighth, to organize common action
   within the United Nations to safeguard the global environment; ninth, to
   encourage young people from all parts of the world to devote themselves to
   international service; tenth, to improve the organization, administration
   and procedures of the United Nations.\n15.\tIf the twenty-fifth General
   Assembly were to move forward substantially in these directions, this
   session would indeed rank as one of the most fruitful in United Nations
   history.\n16.\tLet me now comment briefly on these points.\n17.\tWe shall
   all of us on this podium and in the First Committee have much to say during
   this session about strengthening international peace and security, and about
   the need to live up to the Charter. This is quite proper. However, what is
   needed most in this respect is not still more sweeping declarations that
   merely restate the purposes and principles of the Charter. What is needed is
   more effective United Nations action on the concrete issues before us, on
   the Middle East, on United Nations peacekeeping procedures, on means of
   pacific settlement. Until we demonstrate our willingness to take such
   effective action, world opinion will continue to be skeptical, no matter
   what ringing declarations we may make, as to whether the Members of the
   United Nations are really serious about strengthening international peace
   and security.\n18.\tI now come to a subject which should be at the very
   center of our concern if we wish in fact to strengthen peace and security
   through the United Nations. I speak of United Nations
   peacekeeping.\n19.\tBecause the world situation in the past twenty- five
   years developed differently from what the founders of the United Nations
   foresaw, it has not been found possible to create forces for the maintenance
   of international peace and security along the lines laid down in certain
   articles of Chapter VII. We would hope that at some point the provisions of
   the Charter designed for enforcement action can be implemented.\n20.\tIn the
   meantime, however, a modus vivendi has been built up, entirely consistent
   with the Charter, which has carried out significant and successful
   peacekeeping operations, sometimes with observers, sometimes with
   substantial forces, in the Middle East, in Kashmir, in the Congo, in Cyprus
   and elsewhere. Still it is all too clear that these ad hoc and improvised
   arrangements need major improvement in several respects if future
   peacekeeping is to be effective.\n21.\tThe Assembly's Special Committee on
   Peacekeeping Operations, under the able and patient leadership of Ambassador
   Cuevas Cancino of Mexico, has been laboring for nearly two years at the task
   of developing peacekeeping guidelines. During the past year the United
   States has put forward concrete proposals for new procedures that would meet
   the political concerns of all and yet allow United Nations forces to move
   rapidly to carry out decisions of the Security Council. But the broad
   agreement that all desire is still lacking.\n22.\tIt is high time however
   that the General Assembly, in this twenty-fifth anniversary year, demanded
   significant movement on this problem. It would be a mistake not to move at
   all until all are agreed to move all the way. There is strong reason and
   sufficient consensus for some forward movement at this Assembly. The United
   States will be prepared to join with others in concrete proposals to this
   effect.\n23.\tIn this connexion we welcome the statement made at Lusaka in
   the Declaration of the nonaligned countries concerning the United Nations,
   that measures should be taken at this session of the General Assembly to
   strengthen United Nations peacekeeping, and we look forward with interest to
   proposals that may be made by those present at that meeting.\n24.\tOf
   course, peacekeeping without peaceful settlement is only an expedient,
   necessary but incomplete and inconclusive. The most potent preventive of
   conflict is not machinery but the will of disputing parties to show
   restraint and a spirit of conciliation, and to persist in peaceful methods
   until settlement is reached. This is a solemn obligation of every United
   Nations Member under the Charter, and no nation deserves more honor than
   those who have lived up to it in spite of every obstacle.\n25.\tIn this past
   year such peaceful settlements, or major steps towards them, have been
   recorded in a number of situations which reflect great credit on the
   statesmanship of those involved. I have in mind, for example, the progress
   made, with the assistance of the Organization of American States, toward
   resolving the dispute between El Salvador and Honduras; and also the recent
   peaceful decision on the future of Bahrain, in which good offices provided
   by the Secretary General played a major role.\n26.\tAs these cases show,
   where the will to settle exists, effective machinery can do much to help.
   This is true of regional organizations, and it is no less true of the
   relevant organs of the United Nations, above all the Security
   Council.\n27.\tIn this connexion we have welcomed the Security Council's
   decision [see 1544th meeting] as proposed by Finland, to hold periodic
   high-level meetings under Article 28 of the Charter. My country looks
   forward to taking part in the first such meeting later this fall. We welcome
   likewise the valuable suggestion of Brazil committees of the Council,
   including the parties to a dispute, might be created to help settle
   particular disputes.\n28.\tTo the same end, the United States would favor
   the reactivation of certain machinery for peaceful settlement which has long
   been dormant. Many years ago the General Assembly created a Panel on Inquiry
   and Conciliation [resolution 268 (III)], and more recently a register of
   fact-finding experts. My Government will soon nominate qualified individuals
   for both of these bodies. We believe fact-finders should be available to\n1
   Third Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non Aligned Countries,
   held at Lusaka, Zambia, from 8 to 10 September 1970.\nthe SecretaryGeneral
   or other organs of the United Nations, or directly to Member States, to
   report on the facts of situations of international concern at the request or
   with the consent of one or more of the parties.\n29.\tFinally, it is most
   important that we rejuvenate and strengthen the highest organ of judicial
   settlement, the International Court of Justice. The United States recently
   joined with others in the Security Council in referring to the Court for its
   advisory opinion certain aspects of the Namibia situation. We have also
   joined with others in submitting to this General Assembly an agenda item
   calling for a review of the role of the Court. We hope this review will
   suggest ways to enable the Court to make a more substantial contribution to
   the establishment of the rule of law among nations.\n30.\tThe world has
   witnessed in recent weeks shocking examples of the consequences of failure
   to abide by this rule of law examples which have been alluded to by numerous
   previous speakers on this podium. Hundreds of innocent individuals engaged
   in peaceful international travel have been brutally seized as hostages in a
   conflict in which they were in no way involved. Not only their safety and
   convenience have been placed in jeopardy but their very lives. As President
   Nixon pointed out in this forum a year ago, this issue 'involves the
   interests of. . . every air passenger and the integrity of that structure of
   order upon which a world community depends' [1755th meeting, para.
   74].\n31.\tThat this view is widely shared is evident from the almost
   universal condemnation of these most recent acts by Governments the world
   over and by the resolution on this matter adopted unanimously by the
   Security Council [286 (1970)]. But condemnation is not enough. It is time to
   act. The Tokyo Convention, providing for the prompt return of hijacked
   aircraft passengers and crew, requires the broadest international support.
   The same is true of the International Civil Aviation Organization's draft
   multilateral convention for the extradition and punishment of hijackers. In
   addition, the United States has submitted new proposals to the ICAO, for
   which I urge your most earnest consideration and support.\n32.\tThe General
   Assembly's extensive annual debates and resolutions on many aspects of arms
   control and disarmament have long played, and continue to play, an important
   part in international negotiations on this most critical of all our
   problems. I need only mention the partial nuclear test-ban Treaty,  the
   outer space Treaty [resolution 2222 (XXI)] and the Treaty on the
   NonProliferation of Nuclear Weapons [resolution 2373 (XXII)]. The
   disarmament conference at Geneva has this year registered significant
   progress by achieving wide consensus on a draft treaty to prohibit the
   emplacement of weapons of mass destruction on a vast area of the earth's
   surface the seabed beneath the oceans.  We hope this draft treaty will be
   supported by the General Assembly at this session and opened for signature
   shortly thereafter.\n33.\tI can assure the Assembly that the United States
   Government is unceasingly aware of the worldwide concern and need for an end
   to the arms race and the perilous burden of armaments in all its forms, and
   that we shall do whatever one negotiating partner can do to bring about new
   agreements on new steps toward the ultimate goal of general and complete
   disarmament.\n34.\tPermit me to say a word about a matter of quite different
   but equally wide concern that of human rights throughout the world.\n35.\tIn
   addition to the basic responsibility of Governments to maintain human rights
   for all their citizens, the United Nations under the Charter has a clear
   responsibility in this regard. To strengthen the implementation of that
   responsibility my Government hopes the General Assembly at this session will
   create a new post, that of High Commissioner for Human Rights, to advise
   United Nations organs in this field and to assist States, at their request,
   with human rights problems. This proposal has been thoroughly studied and
   fully justified. It deserves a high priority at the twenty-fifth session of
   the General Assembly.\n36.\tA particular issue of human rights that is of
   acute concern to my Government, among others, is the protection of the
   rights of prisoners of war. While these rights have long since been
   internationally guaranteed, they are in practice still denied to many
   prisoners of war, as American wives and families of such prisoners know to
   their great sorrow. The United States strongly hopes that this Assembly will
   press for worldwide observance of the Geneva Convention relative to the
   Treatment of Prisoners of War, verified by impartial inspection. It is
   intolerable that the tragedy of armed conflict should be compounded by
   additional inhumanities in violation of international norms.\n37.\tIn no
   field have the aims of the United Nations found more dramatic fulfilment
   during its first quarter of a century than in the field of decolonization.
   Before the Second World War a third of mankind lived in colonial
   dependencies. Today the proportion is less than 1 per cent. A revolution of
   independence has created some sixty new nations and has been the main factor
   in increasing the membership of the United Nations from 51 to
   126.\n38.\tHowever, the situation in much of southern Africa is still
   characterized by the denial of self-determination and of racial equality.
   The United Nations and its member States must continue to exert peaceful
   efforts to defend and advance these basic human rights of the peoples
   concerned. Their cause is just and must in time prevail.\n39.\tAgainst these
   evils the United States in recent months has taken further steps. We put
   into effect last May a new policy designed to discourage United States
   investment in, and trade with, Namibia so long as South Africa remains in
   unlawful occupation. We urge other Governments to join us in this policy. My
   Government continues strictly to observe resolutions in regard to sanctions
   against the illegal regime in Rhodesia and in regard to the sale of arms to
   South Africa. We have closed our consulate in Salisbury. We shall continue
   in every peaceful and practicable way to pursue the ends of justice,
   equality and self determination.\n40.\tHigh on the list of the United
   Nations contributions to human progress is its longstanding effort to assist
   in comprehensive global development. That effort is being continued and, we
   hope, improved and strengthened through the launching of the Second United
   Nations Development Decade.\n41.\tThe success of the Decade will depend most
   of all on the policies of Member States, both developed and developing. To
   bring all these policies into effective focus is the ambitious aim of the
   development strategy. The United States strongly supports the strategy which
   is before this Assembly [A 17982, para. 16] and intends to participate fully
   in this common enterprise.\n42.\tI wish to leave no doubt of the serious
   commitment of the United States to the Second Development Decade. President
   Nixon, in a series of policy decisions and especially in his recent
   announcement on the new focus of United States economic assistance, has made
   clear our intention:\n(a)\tTo reverse the downward trend in United States
   development assistance;\n(b)\tTo increase substantially United States
   contributions to multilateral development institutions including the World
   Bank, the International Development Association, the regional development
   banks and the United Nations Development program so that, as the
   capabilities of these institutions increase, we may be able to channel
   through them most of our official development assistance;\n(c)\tFurther to
   encourage the efforts of donor nations to 'untie' their bilateral aid to
   developing countries from the obligation to import products of the donor
   country;\n(<d) To bring United States science and technology more
   effectively to bear on the problems of development, and for this purpose to
   create a new United States International Development Institute;\n(<?) To
   take new steps to stimulate American private investment in developing
   countries within the framework of the developing countries'
   plans.\n43.\tThese approaches are already reflected in the new policies my
   country has announced toward Latin America and Africa, which stress
   continued assistance, greater multilateral participation, and increased
   trade and investment.\n44.\tFinally, bearing in mind the crucial connexion
   between trade and development, the United States is pressing for a
   liberalized system of generalized tariff preferences for products of
   developing countries, with preferential access to the American market, and
   we are urging that the developing countries receive similar access to the
   markets of all developed countries.\n45.\tI wish to add a particular comment
   on the role of the United Nations Development program. This program, in
   cooperation with the specialized agencies, has done important pioneering
   work in development assistance. Its machinery, however, was built for a
   smaller program and must be reorganized to meet its growing
   responsibilities. With the aid of last year's excellent 'capacity study' ,
   the program is now preparing to put the necessary reforms into effect. In
   planning our future contributions to this important program we in the United
   States will give major weight to the progress actually achieved m
   undertaking these reforms.\n46.\tIn recent years people all over the world
   have suddenly awakened to the inexorable and tragic fact that excessive
   population growth can, if continued much longer, frustrate all our hopes for
   peace, justice and progress. There can be no progress for the majority of
   mankind if population growth outstrips all available means of development.
   There can be no justice for the majority of mankind where population expands
   faster than production and social services. There can be no peace for the
   majority of mankind where progress and justice are unattainable because of
   unrestrained population growth.\n47.\tThis is not a problem confined to
   either developed or developing countries. In my own country, although our
   growth rate has recently slowed to about 1 per cent a year, we have adopted
   as a national goal the availability within five years of family planning
   services to every citizen.\n48.\tClearly, the need is equally urgent in many
   nations striving for development whose annual population growth in some
   cases approaches 4 per cent which means a doubling of the number of people
   in less than twenty- years. The care and feeding of such enormous numbers of
   dependent children, their upbringing in conditions compatible with human
   dignity, could constitute such a burden as to nullify progress in economic
   development and to cause living standards to remain at past low levels or
   even to fall lower.\n49.\tThe United States is convinced that the vigorous
   pursuit of family planning policies is an indispensable element in the
   strategy of development. In this conviction we have pledged this year $7.5
   million to the recently established United Nations Fund for Population
   Activities, whose services to requesting Governments are rapidly
   growing.\n50.\tIn the context of development I wish also to emphasize the
   enormous potential of the world's deep seabeds, whose exploitation is just
   now beginning to come within the reach of our technology.\n51.\tLast May
   President Nixon, in a farreaching announcement concerning the oceans,
   proposed that an international regime be established by treaty for the
   exploitation of seabed resources beyond the depth of 200 meters. He further
   proposed that this regime 'should provide for the collection of substantial
   mineral royalties to be used for international community purposes,
   particularly economic assistance to developing countries'. Early in August
   the United States circulated in the United Nations seabed Committee  a draft
   convention [A18021, annex V], embodying these and other important proposals
   in the President's announcement.\n52.\tThese proposals, if carried out, will
   amount to a new departure in the history of nations. Never in history has
   the exploitation of resources of such great potential value been placed
   under the supervision and regulation of an effective international
   authority. Never in history has assurance been offered that the
   international community could have a substantial, independent source of
   revenue to be equitably divided to serve the interests of mankind as a
   whole.\n53.\tThe United States hopes that the twenty-fifth session of the
   General Assembly will advance this important enterprise so that a sound and
   workable international seabed regime, backed up by effective machinery, can
   come into being as soon as possible. To this end it is important that States
   refrain from making further claims to jurisdiction over the seabeds or over
   the waters of the oceans. We believe that a conference on subjects related
   to the law of the sea, including seabeds, should be called as soon as
   practicable and that preparatory steps should be initiated by this session
   of the General Assembly.\n54.\tI come now to an issue of critical and
   rapidly growing importance the protection of the human environment.
   Development and protection of the environment are not mutually
   contradictory; indeed, they must go hand in hand if the world is to be a fit
   place in which to live. The United Nations is in a key position to foster
   the necessary cooperation so that the needs of the environment, as well as
   those of development, receive the energetic attention they
   require.\n55.\tAlready the plans for the United Nations Conference on the
   Human Environment in 1972 have begun to take shape and have helped to focus
   the attention of United Nations Member Governments on this worldwide
   challenge; but we should not wait for the Stockholm Conference before
   launching necessary initiatives.\n56.\tTherefore the United States urges
   that all of us here, representing both developed and developing countries,
   work together to enable the United Nations to take the following steps.
   Firstly, it should identify those environmental problems, especially those
   pollutants in the atmosphere and the oceans, which are or may be dangerous
   on a global scale. Second, it should make plans for a coordinated world
   monitoring network to keep track of these environmental dangers. This
   network should build on existing programs, particularly those of the
   agencies of the United Nations family, and should use the most advanced data
   processing and satellite technology, such as the earth resource survey
   satellites which my country has been developing. Third, it should collect
   and analyze the suggestions of governments concerning environmental
   guidelines for States, both developed and developing, as well as for
   international institutions engaged in development programs. Fourth, it
   should explore the possibility of establishing international air and water
   quality standards. The United States hopes the Assembly at this session will
   act to advance those important objectives.\n51. A newly acute problem which
   threatens a growing number of societies is the epidemic spread of addiction
   to dangerous drugs, especially among young people. This phenomenon has
   mushroomed in a very few years, not only in my own country but in a number
   of others, both developed and developing. It creates untold misery,
   violence, lawlessness and economic and human loss.This menace must be
   stopped. To do so it will be necessary to reinforce existing international
   agreements and to strengthen the longstanding and excellent work of agencies
   in this field, especially those of the United Nations. We are glad to note
   that the Commission on Narcotic Drugs is meeting now to deal with the whole
   range of problems involved, from the poppy field through the international
   syndicate to the needle in the vein. My Government hopes that an adequate
   action program will emerge from this process and will command the energetic
   support of the community of nations. The United States has already offered,
   subject to Congressional approval, a contribution of $2 million to such a
   program.\n58.\tFinally, it is important that we make better use of the
   talents of young people in international service, especially the service of
   the United Nations. Many delegations to this session, including that of the
   United States, contain youthful members as suggested by the General Assembly
   a year ago. That is entirely fitting, because the fate of the United Nations
   and indeed of world peace will soon be in their hands.\n59.\tWith that in
   mind President Nixon, in his address to this Assembly a year ago [1755th
   meeting], pledged the enthusiastic support of the United States for Iran's
   proposal to establish an international volunteer service corps [see 1695th
   meeting, para. 75], to work in the cause of development and to be recruited
   on an individual basis from the people, principally young people, of many
   countries. We hope that proposal will be given final approval in the current
   session. We hope also that the United Nations will seek new ways to
   encourage able young people to find careers in its Secretariat and those of
   the other agencies of the United Nations family.\n60.\tIn these remarks I
   have discussed only a few of the major tasks facing the United Nations in
   the years ahead. Even those, however, are enough tc make it obvious that, if
   we indeed address ourselves to such tasks, the effectiveness of this
   Organization will be tested more severely than ever. To meet this test we
   shall have to be far more attentive than has been our habit to many matters
   of structure, organization and procedure. For example, I would mention the
   following.\n61.\tIn considering applications for membership by very small
   States, we must make sure that they are not only willing but also, as the
   Charter stipulates, able to carry out the Charter's obligations. As the
   SecretaryGeneral has for years pointed out, many Territories now moving
   towards independence are too small, either in population or in resources or
   both, to carry out the minimum obligations which membership requires. Yet
   these very small entities need more than most the assistance that the United
   Nations system can provide. Where the burden of membership would be
   excessive, we should provide a form of association with the United Nations
   which would enable such States to enjoy the benefits without the burdens of
   the system.\n62.\tThe persistence of the United Nations financial deficit
   undermines confidence in the Organization, threatens its capabilities in
   many fields and casts a cloud over its future. The United States welcomes
   the SecretaryGeneral's recent call for 'a concerted effort to restore the
   financial solvency of the Organization'. We hope that he will himself take a
   lead in such an effort, in which we shall certainly play our part.\n63.\tIn
   the annual choice of non-permanent members of the Security Council, it would
   be well that, as the Charter requires, due regard be specially paid, in the
   first instance, to the prospective member's contribution to the maintenance
   of international peace and security, rather than merely to rotation among
   the members of geographic groups.\n64.\tThe primary consideration in
   selecting individuals for posts in the Secretariat, above all for senior
   posts, should be fully to meet the Charter's 'paramount consideration'
   namely 'the highest standards of efficiency, competence, and
   integrity'.\n65.\tWe must at long last take decisive steps to streamline the
   excessively time-consuming organization and procedures of the General
   Assembly, as Canada has wisely proposed, or else we shall either 'drown in a
   sea of words' or suffocate under an avalanche of paper.\n66.\tWe must take
   more effective measures to ensure that the entire United Nations system is
   so organized and managed that it responds efficiently to the directives of
   its governing organs and to the priority needs of the world. That will
   require much better administrative and budgetary coordination and control
   than we have yet achieved.\n67.\tThe United States offers these suggestions
   in the spirit of the twenty-fifth anniversary session, which we understand
   to be a spirit of sober determination to make this Organization more
   effective, to make its future more responsive than its past to the
   imperative needs of men, women and children everywhere. Many other
   delegations have offered or will offer their proposals in the same spirit.
   The test of our seriousness and our success will be how much of this agenda
   of objectives we can begin to carry out.\n68.\tWe are assembled from the
   four corners of the earth. The interests of the Governments we speak for
   often seem to be and sometimes are in contradiction. But by our presence
   here, by our commitment to the United Nations and its Charter, we have
   acknowledged that we also have interests in common, interests in peace,
   justice and progress, interests in the continued habitability of our planet,
   common interests which we are at last beginning to recognize are inescapable
   and overriding.\n69.\tThe question now is, do we have the wit not only to
   perceive these common interests in some vague rhetorical way, but also to
   act upon them together realistically and decisively even at the cost
   sometimes of older and narrower interests? If we do not do so, history may
   sweep aside not only this Organization but also the nations that compose
   it.\n70.\tThe SecretaryGeneral has said that we may have only ten years left
   to cope effectively with the problems of our times before they become so
   staggering as to be beyond our capacities. As we enter the Disarmament
   Decade and the Second Development Decade, let us keep that warning foremost
   in our minds and let us be determined to act together to avert
   catastrophe.\n\n\n\n\n Name: text, dtype: object

OH NO, what the heck!!
----------------------

Unicode errors can be a huge pain, but are a fact of life for anyone dealing
with data from multiple sources. In this case, we can use the unix file command
to get a bit more information:


.. code-block:: none

   $ file -I country_codes.csv
   country_codes.csv: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1


The important part of the result of that command is that it tells us that the
character set is `iso-8859-1`. This piece of information is important, because
it tells Python how to interpret the 8 bits as a character we would recognize.
For example, let's take the familiar copyright Â© symbol. This symbol is stored
in the computer's memory as 10101001. Aren't you glad you don't have to remember
that? When Python tries to display a character for us, it has to know how that
information is **encoded**, that is, how should Python interpret those bits.
There are several common encodings used today.

* ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange): This is one of the
  oldest encodings, and has been in use for years, its major limitation is that
  it can only encode 256 characters. And in fact, Python only interprets 0-127
  as proper ASCII. This was fine for American English, in the early days of
  computing but it does not work in the world today with many languages and many
  more emojis.

* 'utf-8': This is probably the most common encoding in use today. It can
  efficiently encode over 4 billion characters. Some with just 8 bits and others
  with up to 32 bits.

* 'iso-8859-1' (also called 'latin-1'): This encoding takes full advantage of
  all 8 bits of the ascii character set.


So, let's try a little experiment. We can represent 169 as 10101001 or as the
hexadecimal value a9, which is easier to work with in Python.


.. code:: python3

   b'\xa9'.decode('utf8')


.. parsed-literal::

   UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)
   <ipython-input-14-4c06286911b5> in <module>
   ----> 1 b'\xa9'.decode('utf8')

   UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xa9 in position 0: invalid start byte


Aha! That error message looks familiar. (And you will run into this many times
when working with data from the internet).

Lets give ASCII a try.

.. code:: python3

   b'\xa9'.decode('ascii')


.. parsed-literal::

   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   UnicodeDecodeError                        Traceback (most recent call last)

   ----> 1 b'\xa9'.decode('ascii')

   UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xa9 in position 0: ordinal not in range(128)


The message is that the character is not in range(128); yes 169 is definitely
not in range(128).


.. code:: python3

   b'\xa9'.decode('iso-8859-1')


.. parsed-literal::

   'Â©'


Success!!

Fascinating! Until the late 80's, neither global warming or climate change were
mentioned with relatively close to the same frequency until 2006 when climate
change became a huge topic. This raises all kinds of interesting questions.
Which countries were talking about these topics and when? This is exactly the
kind of thing that happens in data science. One question or the visualization of
one or more items often leads to further and even more interesting questions.
