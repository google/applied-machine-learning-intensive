Exploratory Data Analysis Questions
===================================

-  How many unique orders do we have?
-  What is the most popular first item to add to the cart? Does that change by
   day of the week?
-  What is the distribution of the number of items in the shopping cart just
   before checkout?
-  What is the most popular second item?
-  What department or aisle do users most frequently shop first/last?
-  Create a bar chart of the number of items sold by day of the week.
-  What department gets the most sales?
-  Create a chart that shows the number of items bought from each department.
-  Do most people shop linearly? Is there a visualization that would show the
   path that most people take through the store, or by aisle, or by department?
