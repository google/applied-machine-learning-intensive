Introduction
============

Instacart is a shopping and delivery service that works with stores in your city
such as Whole Foods, Costco, and local stores. They pick up your order and
deliver it to your door. Consequently, they have a lot of data on a lot of
different shopping behavior that we can use to make predictions about future
purchases, or suggest items that a person may want to add to their shopping cart
based on their past behavior. Sound familiar? This is the kind of thing that
Amazon has been doing successfully for years.

The Data
--------

The data we will be using in this module is shopping data from Instacart, the
Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, accessed from
https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on October 15, 2018. This
is an enormous data set. (The largest file has over 32 million rows!) We don't
want to start with that file, as that is very big. So, we have a smaller file,
still with 1.3 million rows, with which we can start.


aisles.csv
----------

.. code-block:: none

   aisle_id,aisle
   1,prepared soups salads
   2,specialty cheeses
   3,energy granola bars
   ...


departments.csv
---------------

.. code-block:: none

   department_id,department
   1,frozen
   2,other
   3,bakery
   ...


order_products__prior.csv
-------------------------

These files specify which products were purchased in each order.
``order_products__prior.csv`` contains previous order contents for all
customers. ``reordered`` indicates that the customer has a previous order that
contains the product. Note that some orders will have no reordered items.
``order_products_train.csv`` is much smaller (even though it hasm 1.3 million
records), and is a better place to start.


.. code-block:: none

   order_id,product_id,add_to_cart_order,reordered
   1,49302,1,1
   1,11109,2,1
   1,10246,3,0
   ...


orders.csv
----------

This file tells to which set (prior, train, test) an order belongs. You are
predicting reordered items only for the test set orders. ``order_dow`` is the
day of week.


.. code-block:: none

   order_id,user_id,eval_set,order_number,order_dow,order_hour_of_day,days_since_prior_order
   2539329,1,prior,1,2,08,
   2398795,1,prior,2,3,07,15.0
   473747,1,prior,3,3,12,21.0
   ...


products.csv
------------

.. code-block:: none

   product_id,product_name,aisle_id,department_id
