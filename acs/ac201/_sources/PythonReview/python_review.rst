Python Review
=============

Python variables don't have a type so they can seamlessly change from being a
numerical value, a string, other things.


.. code:: python3

   my_var = 3
   print(type(my_var))
   my_var = "foo"
   print(type(my_var))
   my_var = len  # Even a function!
   print(type(my_var))


.. parsed-literal::

   <class 'int'>
   <class 'str'>
   <class 'builtin_function_or_method'>


Strings can be represented with single or double quotes. Triple quotes make it
easy to define multi-line strings.


.. code:: python3

   # \n means newline

   my_var = 'foo\nbar'
   print("1:", my_var)
   my_var = "foo\nbar"
   print("2:", my_var)
   my_var = """foo
   bar"""
   print("3:", my_var)


.. parsed-literal::

   1: foo
   bar
   2: foo
   bar
   3: foo
   bar


Python can convert variable from one type to another.


.. code:: python3

   my_string = str(123)
   my_int = int(my_string)
   almost_pi = float("3.14159")


Remember that you can import useful modules that add functionality to Python, as
below.


.. code:: python3

   import random
   random.randrange(20, 30)


.. parsed-literal::

   26


Re-run the above cell to see that it produces different outputs.

For loops can be used to iterate numerical values like in other programming
languages with the range function.


.. code:: python3

   for i in range(0, 10):
       print(i)


.. parsed-literal::

   0
   1
   2
   3
   4
   5
   6
   7
   8
   9


But can also be used to visit every item in a list.


.. code:: python3

   for color in ["red", "green", "blue"]:
       print(color)


.. parsed-literal::

   red
   green
   blue


Remember that the contents of the for loop have to be indented at the same level
to differentiate them from code outside the for loop.


.. code:: python3

   for i in range(3):
       print("repeated")
       print("also repeated")
   print("not repeated")


.. parsed-literal::

   repeated
   also repeated
   repeated
   also repeated
   repeated
   also repeated
   not repeated


Getting back to lists, they are a basic type in Python and they can contain a
mix of different types.


.. code:: python3

   my_list = ["string", 1, [2.0, 4.5], 5.6]  # Don't do that
   my_list = []                              # An empty list
   my_list = [3, 4, 6, 2, 45, 23, 12, 34]    # That's better


Lists are mutable so you can overwrite arbitrary values.


.. code:: python3

   my_list[2] = 64
   my_list


.. parsed-literal::

   [3, 4, 64, 2, 45, 23, 12, 34]


Remember that indexes start at 0.


.. code:: python3

   my_list[0]


.. parsed-literal::

   3


And you use negative indexes to refer to values starting from the end of the
list.


.. code:: python3

   my_list[-2]


.. parsed-literal::

   12


You can also use slices to rapidly grab portion of the list.


.. code:: python3

   my_list[0:2]


.. parsed-literal::

   [3, 4]


You can also perform a variety of operations on lists.


.. code:: python3

   print(len(my_list))
   print(min(my_list))
   print(max(my_list))
   print(sum(my_list))
   print(my_list * 2)

   # Changes my_list
   my_list.append(146)

   # Doesn't change my_list, need to store returned value
   other_list = my_list + [1, 2, 3]

   print(other_list)


.. parsed-literal::

   10
   2
   146
   479
   [3, 4, 64, 2, 45, 23, 12, 34, 146, 146, 3, 4, 64, 2, 45, 23, 12, 34, 146, 146]
   [3, 4, 64, 2, 45, 23, 12, 34, 146, 146, 146, 1, 2, 3]


Some of these operations work on strings too.


.. code:: python3

   my_var = "Abc defg hij"
   print(len(my_var))
   print(max(my_var)) # This doesn't work
   # sum(my_var) # Nor this
   # my_var[1] = 'v' # Nor this
   print(my_var[2:6])
   print(my_var * 2)


.. parsed-literal::

   12
   j
   c de
   Abc defg hijAbc defg hij


Strings also have special abilities.


.. code:: python3

   print(my_var.lower())
   print(my_var.upper())
   print(my_var.title())
   print(my_var.startswith("Abc"))
   print(my_var.endswith("xyz"))
   list_of_string = my_var.split(" ")
   new_string = "#$#".join(list_of_string)
   print(new_string)


.. parsed-literal::

   abc defg hij
   ABC DEFG HIJ
   Abc Defg Hij
   True
   False
   Abc#$#defg#$#hij


Use double-equals (==) to test for equality.


.. code:: python3

   if sum(my_list) == 333:
       print("It's 333 exactly!")
   else:
       print("It's some other value")


.. parsed-literal::

   It's some other value


But you can test for a lot of different relations.


.. code:: python3

   if (my_list[0] > 20 and
       my_list[1] <= 14 or
       my_list[2] != 5 and
       4 in my_list and
       65 not in my_list):
       print("Weird condition")


.. parsed-literal::

   Weird condition


So to add up all the odd numbers in ``my_list``.


.. code:: python3

   total = 0
   for val in my_list:
       if val % 2 == 1:
           total += val
   total


.. parsed-literal::

   71


To read a file, we use the ``open`` function. Using ``with`` avoids having to
remember to close the file.


.. code:: python3

   with open('mydata.txt', 'r') as md:
       for line in md:
           pass # Do something with each line


Dictionaries are another very handy, built-in data type in Python (theyâ€™re hash
tables, if you've use another language that uses that name). Dictionaries can be
created in a variety of ways.


.. code:: python3

   my_dict = {}   # Empty dict
   my_dict = {'foo': 'bar', 'baz': 'bak'}
   # This one is handy if you have a list of pairs to turn into a dictionary.
   my_dict = dict([['foo', 'bar'], ['baz', 'bak']])


``'foo'`` and ``'baz'`` are called keys, ``'bar'`` and ``'bak'`` are called
values. You can access values in the dictionary with its key.


.. code:: python3

   my_dict['foo']


.. parsed-literal::

   'bar'


And you can add new values (or overwrite old ones) by key as well.


.. code:: python3

   my_dict['hello'] = 'world'
   my_dict['hello'] = 'goodbye'


You can iterate over a dictionary using a for loop.


.. code:: python3

   for key in my_dict:
       print("The key", key, "maps to the value", my_dict[key])


.. parsed-literal::

   The key foo maps to the value bar
   The key baz maps to the value bak
   The key hello maps to the value goodbye


You can define your own functions using the ``def`` keyword and ``return`` to
specify the value that is returned by the function.


.. code:: python3

   def double_plus_y(x, y=4):
       return 2 * x + y

   double_plus_y(6)


.. parsed-literal::

   16


But functions don't have to take parameters (``x`` and ``y`` in the example
above) or return anything.

.. code:: python3

   def say_hi():
       print("Just saying 'hello'.")

   say_hi()


.. parsed-literal::

   Just saying 'hello'.


The map function allows us to call a function on each item in a list.


.. code:: python3

   for value in map(double_plus_y, my_list):
       print(value)


.. parsed-literal::

   10
   12
   132
   8
   94
   50
   28
   72
   296
   296
   296


For a simple, one-time-use function, we don't have to define a function, we can
use lambda to define the operation in-line.


.. code:: python3

   for value in map(lambda x: 2 * x, my_list): # Don't need a separate function.
       print(value)


.. parsed-literal::

   6
   8
   128
   4
   90
   46
   24
   68
   292
   292
   292


Note that lambda functions don't use the ``return`` keyword, you just specify
the names of the parameters of the function (``x`` in the example above), a
colon, and the operation to perform on the parameter(s).

You can also use
`list comprehension <https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/list-comprehensions-in-python>`_
to perform an operation on every item in the list. It looks a little bit like a
for loop inside of a list.


.. code:: python3

   [x*2 for x in my_list]


.. parsed-literal::

   [6, 8, 128, 4, 90, 46, 24, 68, 292, 292, 292]


You can also use it to filter out values from a list. For example, the below
extracts every odd values from the list.


.. code:: python3

   [x for x in my_list if x % 2 == 1]


.. parsed-literal::

   [3, 45, 23]


You can even combine filtering and other operations.


.. code:: python3

   # Square every value less than 10.
   [x**2 for x in my_list if x<10]


.. parsed-literal::

   [9, 16, 4]


List Comprehension Exercises
----------------------------

Let's practice list comprehensions. To do so, we're going to be using a list of
city and state names. Fun fact: these are all
`real cities <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_U.S._place_names>`_
in the US, but with a more famous namesake in a different state.

Use list comprehension to produce a list of only the cities whose name
(including the state name) are less than 12 characters long.


.. code:: python3

   cities = [
       'washington,ct',
       'springfield,or',
       'riverside,tx',
       'franklin,vt',
       'lebanon,co',
       'dayton,tx',
       'las vegas,nm',
       'madison,ca',
       'georgetown,ct',
       'los angeles,tx',
   ]
   short_cities = []
   short_cities


.. parsed-literal::

   ['franklin,vt', 'lebanon,co', 'dayton,tx', 'madison,ca']


Next, create a list of abbreviations that are just the first 3 letters of each
city name.


.. code:: python3

   abbreviations = []
   abbreviations


.. parsed-literal::

   ['was', 'spr', 'riv', 'fra', 'leb', 'day', 'las', 'mad', 'geo', 'los']


Use list comprehension to create a dictionary that maps city names to the states
that they are located in.


.. code:: python3

   city_dict = []
   city_dict


.. parsed-literal::

   {'washington': 'ct',
    'springfield': 'or',
    'riverside': 'tx',
    'franklin': 'vt',
    'lebanon': 'co',
    'dayton': 'tx',
    'las vegas': 'nm',
    'madison': 'ca',
    'georgetown': 'ct',
    'los angeles': 'tx'}


For a more challenging list comprehension, write a single list comprehension
that produces the
`title-cased <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_Case>`_ version of
just the city names of the cities in Texas (that means that the states should
not be the resulting list).


.. code:: python3

   texas = []
   texas


.. parsed-literal::

   ['Riverside', 'Dayton', 'Los Angeles']
