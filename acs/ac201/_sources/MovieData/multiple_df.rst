Dealing with Multiple DataFrames
================================

Forget about budget or runtimes as criteria for selecting a movie, let's take a
look at popular opinion. Our dataset has two relevant columns: ``vote_average``
and ``vote_count``.

Let's create a variable called ``df_high_rated`` that only contains movies that
have received more than 20 votes, and whose average score is greater than 8.


.. code:: python3

   df_highly_voted = []
   df_high_rated = []
   df_high_rated[['title', 'vote_average', 'vote_count']]


Here we have some high-quality movies, at least according to some people.


.. fillintheblank:: mov_highly_rated

   How many highly-rated movies are in this dataset? |blank|

   - :178: Is the correct answer

But what about **my** opinion?

Here are my favorite movies and their relative scores. Create a DataFrame called
``compare_votes`` that contains the title as an index and both the
``vote_average`` and ``my_vote`` as its columns. Also, only keep the movies that
are both my favorites and popular favorites.

**Hint:** You'll need to create two Series, one for my ratings and one that maps
titles to vote_average.


.. code:: python3

   {
       "Star Wars": 9,
       "Paris is Burning": 8,
       "Dead Poets Society": 7,
       "The Empire Strikes Back": 9.5,
       "The Shining": 8,
       "Return of the Jedi": 8,
       "1941": 8,
       "Forrest Gump": 7.5,
   }

   compare_votes


There should be only 6 movies remaining.

Now add a column to ``compare_votes`` that measures the percentage difference
between my rating and the popular rating for each movie. You'll need to take the
different between the ``vote_average`` and ``my_vote`` and divide it by
``my_vote``.


.. code:: python3

   compare_votes


.. fillintheblank:: mov_star_wars_difference

   What's the proportion (as a decimal) difference between my rating for Star
   Wars and its popular rating? |blank|
