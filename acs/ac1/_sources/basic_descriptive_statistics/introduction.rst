Introduction
============

Statistics are everywhere: in news articles, sports, government reports, 
research papers, just to name a few. Using statistics is so popular because
they provide evidence and credibility to claims.

Here are just a few examples of how a variety of fields use statistics:

-  Journalists use data to substantiate their reporting.
-  Political leaders use data to inform their decisions.
-  Sports teams and businesses lean heavily on statistical algorithms for their 
actions.
-  Psychologists use statistics to give meaning to the data they collected.

As much as statistics are used, statistics are also frequently misused. One of 
the most important mediums in which statistics are often misused is the news. 
Since the claims they make often impact the decisions you make, it’s important 
for you to be able to critically assess those statistics.

Consider the following two sentences:

1. “Americans are spending a lot of time watching TV.” 
2. “Adult Americans are spending five hours and four minutes on average 
   watching TV per day.” 

Although both sentences make the same point, the statistic used in the second 
sentence is much more specific than the first. The specificity of statistics is 
a powerful tool that allows you to support your own claims or drive your own 
decision-making in any field of work or study.
