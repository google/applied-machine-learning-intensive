What Is A Statistic?
====================

Many people discuss statistics, but not everyone knows what a statistic actually
is.


.. admonition:: Statistic Definition

   **A statistic is a fact of the data.** A statistic is any piece of
   information you can get from a set of data.



For example, suppose you have a dataset containing the heights of all students
in this class. 


.. image:: figures/height_statistic.png
   :align: center


The following are all statistics from that dataset.

-   The shortest height is 146cm.
-   The tallest height is 192cm.
-   There are 19 students in this class.
-   The average height is 166.16cm.
-   The sum of all heights in the class is 3157cm.
-   Half the maximum height is 96cm.

Some statistics are more common and useful than others. For example, knowing 
the average height will likely be more useful in real life than knowing the sum
of all heights. This chapter will guide you through the most common descriptive
statistics.

Suppose you have a dataset on how far students travel to get to school.
