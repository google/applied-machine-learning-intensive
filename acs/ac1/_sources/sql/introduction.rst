Introduction
============

As mentioned in the preface, SQL (which stands for Structured Query Language) is
a programming language that is used to get, store, and change information in a
database. SQL is one of the most widely used programming languages today, and
can be used in any field where there is data.

You may be wondering when you would need to use SQL since you already know how
to use Sheets. SQL does many of the things that you have learned in the previous
sections, but it also does them on a much larger scale. Imagine a spreadsheet
with one billion rows!

You can use SQL to analyze anything from stock market prices to patient data at
a major hospital. If you have a database with any kind of data, you can use SQL
to store and analyze it. In addition, SQL allows you to reorganize data across
different datasets. This chapter will teach you how to use SQL to automate data
analysis so that you can effectively navigate large datasets that might be
cumbersome to navigate by hand.
