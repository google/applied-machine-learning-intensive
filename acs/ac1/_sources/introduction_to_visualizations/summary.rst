Summary
=======

A **data visualization** is any visualization of data (i.e. tables, line graphs,
maps, pies, infographics, etc.).

When **reading a visualization** you should consider:

- the author
- the rigorosity of the review the visualizations has gone through
- the data being represented
- possible biases of the author
- the main point of the visualization
- the motivation behind the type of visualization chosen

When **creating a visualization** you should consider:
- the point youâ€™re trying to make
- the content your visualization will have
- the audience of the visualization
- the accessibility of the visualization
- the understandability of the visualization
- the visualization type

**Histograms** and **bar charts** are graphs with vertical bars of different
heights. They are normally used for counting (examples data they display
include: human population in different countries, frequency of train arrival at
different times, and the number of people who get different grades).
