Visualization Checklists
========================

What should I look for when reading a visualization?
----------------------------------------------------

When you find a visualization online, it is important to ensure that you
understand where the data is coming from and how this may affect how it is
presented. Being able to interpret visualizations is a fundamental skill in data
science. Like any form of media, a visualization has an author. As such, it has
potential biases, and can be interpreted in different ways.

Here is a checklist of important things to consider when reading a visualization.

1.  Who is the **author** of the visualization?

    -   Is the author a single person, or is the author writing on behalf of an
        organization?
    -   Is the author an experienced statistician and/or writer?

2.  How rigorously has the visualization (or the article in which the
    visualization appears) been **reviewed**?

    -   For example, if the visualization appears in *The New York Times* it has
        likely been thoroughly reviewed, whereas if the visualization is part of
        a personal blog it may not have been.

3.  What **data** is backing the visualization?

    -   It is *crucial* to know what data is used to make the visualization. For
        example:

        -   **Location**: Is it global data, or is it a specific
            country/state/region?
        -   **Demographic**: Is it a subset of people, specified by something
            like (but not limited to) race/gender/age?
        -   **Sampling**: Does it include *all* of the people in a given
            population, or just a sample? Is the sample random? How was the
            sample chosen? (For example, if you were conducting a study of
            students at your college, your population of interest would be all
            students at the college, while a sample would be just the students
            in your dorm.)

4.  What **biases** might the author have?

    -   Especially if the visualization is on a media platform, it may have
        unconscious or conscious bias. This may include, but is not limited to:

        -   political bias
        -   racial bias
        -   product bias (i.e. if the author trying to promote/sell something)

5.  What **point** is the author trying to make with the visualization?

    -   A visualization is an author’s choice of medium to convey facts and/or
        opinions.
    -   What are these core facts and/or opinions?

6.  Why has the author chosen this **type** of visualization?

    -   The “type” of visualization indicates the format, e.g. Is it a table? Is
        it a pie chart?
    -   What does this type of visualization do to accentuate their point?

Find an example of a data visualization online. Follow the checklist above with
your chosen visualization.

What should I keep in mind when creating a visualization?
---------------------------------------------------------

Now that you have been able to examine some existing visualizations, it's time
for you to make your own! There are several choices for you to consider when
making visualizations that are accessible for viewers.

1.  What **point** do you intend to make with the visualization?

    -   It is important to keep in mind what facts and/or opinions you are
        trying to convey with your visualization.

2.  What is the **content** of the visualization?

    -   What data will you need?
    -   What aspects of the data will you need to showcase?

3.  Who is the **audience** of the visualization?

    -   The audience of your visualization will impact everything in the
        visualization, from the type of graphic to the style of language used.
    -   It is also crucial to know how data-competent your audience is. You want
        everyone who sees this visualization to understand it.

4.  Make the visualization **physically accessible to all**.

    -   `More than 1 billion people have some form of disability.`_
    -   For example: Will a dyslexic person understand your visualization? Will
        a color-blind person understand your visualization?
    -   `This article identifies some key considerations for accessible data
        visualizations.`_

5.  Make the visualization **understandable to all**.

    -   Think about things like language, color, size, and ask: Is this the
        simplest way to express this information?
    -   How simple/complicated should your visualization be, depending on the
        technical understanding of your audience?

6.  Try **different types** of visualization.

    -   The “type” of visualization indicates the format, e.g. Is it a table? Is
        it a pie chart?
    -   How do you know a specific type of visualization is the best unless you
        try others?
