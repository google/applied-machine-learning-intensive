Project Description
-------------------

In this project, you will design a survey to answer a research question of your
own, and then share the results.

Here are the steps you’ll need to complete.

1.  Form a group of no more than 4 people.

    -   You may want to form a group with people who are in a similar major or
        have similar interests as this may make question selection easier.

2.  Decide on a research question with your group members. Your question should
    ask about the relationship between **two or more** attributes.

    -   Examples of a good research question: Does handedness (left or right)
        have an impact on whether you played a sport in high school? Do people
        who have dogs walk more than people who don’t?
    -   Example of an inadequate question: What percent of people are
        left-handed? (This question involves only one attribute.)

3.  Design a survey with questions to help you answer your research question.
    Remember to create clear questions that elicit specific answers.

4.  Deploy your survey and collect **at least 30** responses.

    -   Having trouble getting enough responses, or want more participants? Try
        social media!

5.  Analyze your dataset by calculating summary statistics for the groups of
    interest. Remember to answer your research question, though you may have
    other insights you’d like to share as well.

    -   To answer your research question, you’ll need to subset the data in some
        way. (For example, compare left-handed people to right-handed people.)
    -   You may need to do some basic data cleaning of the data.
    -   Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and
        variance) from your data for each subset and compare the statistics for
        the groups of interest.

6.   Visualize your findings.

    -   You may use whatever chart types you like.
    -   Be sure to include a few sentences on what each chart conveys.

7.  Share your results. Make a slide deck to share with the class that includes
    answers to the following.

    -   What is your research question?
    -   Where did your data come from?
    -   What is your answer to the research question?
    -   What are possible sources of bias, and how would you improve your study
        next time?

8.  Submit your slides, sheet used for analysis, and a link to your survey by
    **[Due Date]**.

9.  **Optional** (faculty can decide whether to include or not): After
    completing and submitting your project, complete the group work self
    assessment and group assessment.

   * -
     - **Excellent**
     - **Developing**
     - **Beginning**
     - **NA / Not Present**

   * - **Research Question (4)**
     - Research question is included in the slides. Question is clear and
       specific and relates to at least two attributes.
     - Question has minor issues with clarity or specificity.
     - Question is unclear or not specific, or the question is about a single
       attribute.
     - There is no research question.

   * - **Survey Questions (8)**
     - Survey questions are clear and can be used to answer the research
       question.
     - Survey questions are unclear or inappropriate/irrelevant for answering
       the research question.
     - Survey questions are unclear and inappropriate/irrelevant for answering
       the research question.
     - Survey questions not submitted.

   * - **Survey Responses (4)**
     - 30 or more responses are collected.
     - Between 15 and 29 responses are collected.
     - Fewer than 15 responses are collected.
     - No responses are collected.

   * - **Survey Sources (6)**
     - Methods for recruiting participants are outlined in the slides.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are outlined in the slides, but in
       insufficient depth.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are mentioned in the slides, but not
       discussed.
     - Methods for recruiting participants are not outlined in the slides.

   * - **Statistical Analysis (8)**
     - Analysis includes a complete and data-supported comparison of the two
       groups of interest in the research question. This includes a comparison
       of centers (mean and median) and spread (standard deviation and/or
       variance).
     - There is an attempt at a statistical analysis to answer the research
       question but there are minor errors or inconsistencies.
     - Analysis includes an incomplete or not data-supported comparison of the
       groups in the research question.
     - The slides have no mention of a statistical comparison of two groups.

   * - **Visualization (6)**
     - Visualizations are accurate, relevant to the research question, and well
       presented.
     - Visualizations are broadly relevant to the research question but either
       contain inaccuracies or are not well presented.
     - Visualizations are not completely accurate or relevant to the research
       question.
     - Slides do not include a visualization.

   * - **Summary of Results (4)**
     - Slides include a summary of results that answers the research question,
       This summary is accurate given the data, and consistent with the
       statistical analysis and visualizations.
     - Slides include a summary of results that answers the research question.
       This summary either contains inaccuracies or inconsistencies with the
       rest of the slides.
     - Slides include a summary of results that is incomplete or unrelated to
       the research question.
     - Slides do not include a summary of results.

   * - **Issues and Next Steps (6)**
     - Slides include a section identifying issues and sources of potential
       bias. Slides include a discussion on possible steps to improve the study
       in the future.
     - Slides lack detail in identifying either issues or next steps, or have
       missed significant sources of bias in their survey.
     - Slides are either missing a section on issues and next steps, or the
       section(s) are minimal and lack depth.
     - Slides do not include a section on issues or on next steps.

   * - **Readability (4)**
     - The slides are colorful and easy to read (in terms of font and
       font-size). The slides have very few spelling/grammar errors.
     - Slides are generally easy to read with some small but non-negligible
       exceptions.
     - Slides have issues with font or lack color. The report has several
       spelling/grammar errors.
     - There are no slides.
