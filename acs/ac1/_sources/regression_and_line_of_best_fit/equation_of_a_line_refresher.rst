All line equations in this text will be presented in the form y = m*x +
b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. The **y-intercept** is
the y-value at the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The
`slope <#interpreting-slope>`__ gives the steepness of the line, and can
be positive, negative, or zero.
