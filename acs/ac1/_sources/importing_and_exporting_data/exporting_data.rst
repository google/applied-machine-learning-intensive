Exporting Data {#exporting-data}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exporting data is even easier than importing data. If you have a file
sheet that is ready for export, you can just click “File > Download”,
and choose which format you need to export to. The format options are:

-  .xlsx (compatible with Microsoft Excel)
-  .ods (compatible with Linux LibreOffice)
-  .pdf (readable on any system but non-editable)
-  .csv (the most common format for data storage)
-  .tsv (also widely used, but less so than csv)

Another useful tool in Sheets allows you to publish your data online. If
you click “File > Publish to the web”, you can publish your entire file
or a specified sheet as a web page, or as any of the downloadable file
formats above.
