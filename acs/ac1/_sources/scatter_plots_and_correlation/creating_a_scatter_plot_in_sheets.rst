Creating a Scatter Plot in Sheets {#creating-a-scatter-plot-in-sheets}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Video of making January scatterplot.

Using the “Insert” menu, make a scatter plot with latitude as the
explanatory variable and July mean temperature as the explained
variable. Make sure to customize your chart by adding vertical and
horizontal axis labels. This scatterplot is similar to the first, in
that as latitude increases, the mean temperature drops. In this chart,
however, the drop in temperature is not as dramatic as it was for the
mean January temperatures. In the next section, you’ll learn how to
describe this difference with more precision.

Question: What city represents the point furthest to the right on the
scatter plot?

   A: Seattle

Question: What city represents the point closest to the x axis on the
scatter plot?
