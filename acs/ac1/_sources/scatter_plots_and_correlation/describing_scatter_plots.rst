Describing Scatter Plots
========================

Question: Match each scatter plot to each description.

1. The explanatory variable (x) is age in years and the explained
   variable (y) is the annual salary for a sample of working adults
   between the ages of 18 and 65.

   ::Answer: Bottom Left. Most adults make more money as they get older, but
     there are many other factors, like education and career that also impact
     salary.


2. The explanatory variable (x) is the mean commute time in minutes and
   the explained variable (y) is height in inches for a sample of
   employees at a small company.

   ::Answer: Bottom Right. Thereâ€™s no real relationship between height and
     commute time.

3. The explanatory variable (x) is the month of the year, starting in
   January, and the explained variable (y) is the mean temperature for
   that month for St. Louis, Missouri which has cold winters and warm
   summers.

   ::Answer: Middle left. Cold winters and warm summers means smaller values
     close to the end points 1 = January and 12 = December, and higher
     temperatures in the middle.

4. The explanatory variable (x) is the city miles per gallon and the
   explained variable (y) is the highway miles per gallon for a sample
   of cars.

   ::Answer: Top Right. Cars with higher city mpg also have higher highway
     mpg.

5. The explanatory variable (x) is the number of hours after e-coli has
   been introduced to a petri dish and the explained variable (y) is the
   estimated number of e-coli cells after t hours. The number of cells
   doubles about every 20 minutes.

   ::Answer: Top left. Because the number of cells is doubling, the change
     every 20 minutes at the beginning of the experiment is small compared to
     the change every 20 minutes at the end of the experiment when there are
     much more cells dividing.

6. The explanatory variable (x) is the years of driving experience and the
   explained variable (y) is the insurance premium paid for a sample of drivers.

   ::Answer: Middle Right. Drivers with more driving experience are considered
     safer, so they pay smaller premiums. Similarly, drivers with less driving
     experience are considered riskier and pay greater premiums.

When describing the shape of the scatter plot and the relationship
between the explanatory and explained variable, there are three
important features to discuss.

-  The **direction** of a scatter plot can be described as positive or
   negative. The direction is positive when the explained variable
   increases as the explanatory variable increases, or the points of the
   scatterplot go up from left to right. The direction is negative when
   the explained variable decreases as the explanatory variable
   increases, or the points of the scatterplot go down from left to
   right.
-  The **strength** of a scatter plot is usually described as weak,
   moderate or strong. The more spread out the points are, the weaker
   the relationship. If the points are clearly clustered, or closely
   follow a curve or line, the relationship is described as strong.
-  The **linearity** of scatter plot indicates how close the points are
   to a straight line. Scatter plots are described as linear or
   nonlinear.

For example, the scatterplot of latitude and January temperatures had
negative direction, as the greater the latitude, the colder the
temperature. Though there are a few outliers *(link to module A outliers
section)* (cities along the northwest coast of the US that have
temperate winters, such as Portland, OR) there is a strong, linear
trend.

Question: Match each scatterplot below with its description.

1. Neither positive nor negative, strong, nonlinear

   ::Middle left

2. Positive, moderate, linear

   ::Bottom left

3. No relationship

   ::Bottom right

4. Negative, moderate, linear

   ::Middle right

5. Positive, strong, linear

   ::Top right

6. Positive, strong, nonlinear

   ::Top left
