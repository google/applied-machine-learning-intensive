Now that Sheets is more familiar so that you can put data there, you will
learn how Sheets can also be used to organize that data more easily. 
Sheets has functions that allow you to **filter** as well as **group**
data. For example, if you had the table below you could use filtering and
grouping to more easily display certain data.
