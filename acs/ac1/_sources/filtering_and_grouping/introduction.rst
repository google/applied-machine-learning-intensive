Introduction
============

Now that Sheets is more familiar and you know how it can hold data, you will
learn how Sheets can also be used to organize that data. Sheets has functions
that allow you to **filter** as well as **group** data. For example, if you had
the table below you could use filtering and grouping to more easily display 
certain data. 

.. image:: figures/table_data_example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Table of data.

Above is a table with some standard information collected from a group of people.
Below is the same data from the table before after filtering and grouping is
separately applied.

   :align: center
   :alt: The same table of data after applying a filter.

.. mchoice:: table_filter

   Can you guess what kind of filter was used on the table?

   - See Answer

     + The table was filtered in the gender column, alphabetically from Z to A.

.. image:: figures/table_group_example.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The same table after applying grouping.

.. mchoice:: table_filter

   Can you guess what kind of grouping was used on the table? 

   - See Answer

     + The table was grouped using the ``COUNTIF`` function to count how many people came from Los Angeles.

Don't worry if that was confusing. This exercise was to help get you more familiar 
with potential uses for filtering and grouping on a data set.
