Overview
--------

One of the most fundamental use cases for statistics is investigating
the relationship between multiple variables. There are always new
stories in the media that discuss links between two or more variables.
For example:

-  `Does eating more chocolate increase your life
   expectancy?

-  `Do vaccines increase the chance of
   autism? <https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/autism.html>`__
-  `Does drinking red wine improve your heart
   health?
<https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/is-red-wine-good-actually-for-your-heart-2018021913285>`__
-  `Does gun ownership rate increase gun
   fatalities?
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/22/us/gun-ownership-violence-statistics.html>`__
-  `Does home field advantage in sports really
   exist?
<https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nfls-home-field-advantage-is-real-but-why/>`__
-  `Does reading Harry Potter reduce a personâ€™s
   prejudice?
<https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/harry-potter-jk-rowling-reduce-prejudice-study-journal-applied-psychology-a7414706.html>`__

What is especially remarkable is that for every article with a
statistical study that argues for one thing, there is usually at least
one for the other side. Especially today, as there is so much news from
so many diverse sources, it has become increasingly important to
decipher which studies are trustworthy, what statistics are reliable,
and what findings are legitimate.

In the next few chapters, you will learn much more about analyzing the
relationship between variables. This will help you investigate the
relationship between pairs of variables for your own analysis, as well
as critically assess the statistical findings you read about in the
media.
