Filtering
=========

The notion of filtering data should already be familiar to you. Filtering data
is to look at only a subset of rows, based on some column condition. For
example, if you have a database containing information for all citizens of the
USA, a filter could be applied to look only at residents of Texas. You have
already seen :ref:`how to apply filters in Sheets<filtering_data>`.

Filtering data in SQL is as simple as using the ``WHERE`` keyword. You can
append ``WHERE column_condition`` to any SQL query, and the result will be
filtered only to rows that satisfy the column condition. For example, you might
want to look only at bike trips which are at least one hour (3600 seconds).


.. activecode:: bikeshare_rides_over_60_minutes
   :language: sql
   :dburl: /_static/bikeshare.db

   SELECT
     member_type,
     start_date,
     duration
   FROM
     trip_data
   WHERE
     duration >= 3600
   LIMIT
     10


Itâ€™s also possible to filter by multiple criteria. For example to look at bike
trips which are 60 minutes or more and the ``member_type`` is ``MEMBER``, the
query would be as below.


.. activecode:: bikeshare_rides_over_60_minutes_by_members
   :language: sql
   :dburl: /_static/bikeshare.db

   SELECT
     member_type,
     start_date,
     duration
   FROM
     trip_data
   WHERE
     duration >= 3600 AND
     member_type = 'Member'
   LIMIT
     10


.. shortanswer:: bikeshare_rides_over_8_hours_by_W01274

   Write a query to find the ending station and duration of all of trips by bike
   number W01274 that lasted over 8 hours.


.. fillintheblank:: bikeshare_trips_starting_and_ending_at_31111

   How many trips started and ended at station 31111? |blank|
