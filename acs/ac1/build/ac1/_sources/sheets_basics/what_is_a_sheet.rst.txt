What Is A Sheet?
================

Fundamentally, a sheet is a table, or a matrix. It is a 2-dimensional way of
viewing **data** (any form of information that you can type on a computer
keyboard), through rows and columns. Sheets is often used to store a
**dataset**, which is a related set of different data points. Below is the key
terminology you need to know when using Sheets.


.. admonition:: Basic Definitions

   -   **Cell**: A cell is the smallest unit in a sheet. Each cell can contain
       any form of data.
   -   **Column**: A column is a vertical group of cells, defined in Sheets with
       a *letter*.
   -   **Row**: A row is a horizontal group of cells, defined in Sheets with a
       *number*.
   -   **Sheet**: Each sheet contains its own table. You can create as many
       sheets as you like.

Note that a cell is usually defined by a letter and a number (in that order, by
convention): the letter of the column and the number of the row. In the video
below, **the highlighted cell is B2, meaning the column is B, and the row is
2**.

Example: Painters
-----------------

The definitions above might be a bit abstract. Sheets makes a lot more sense
when there is data, so here is an example. The dataset below contains
information about 50 of the most prolific painters of all time.

In general:

-   **Each row is an observation of the data.** In this example, each row is a
    painter. For example, row 8 (where id = 6) tells you about Edouard Manet. If
    you were to add a new painter to this dataset, you would add a new row.
-   **Each column is an attribute of the data.** In this example, each column
    tells you something about the painter (e.g. “name”, “years”). For example,
    column E tells you about a painter’s nationality. If you were to add a new
    attribute to this dataset (e.g. the number of children they had), you would
    add a new column.
-   **Each cell is an attribute of an observation.** In this example, each cell
    tells you something specific about a given painter. For example, cell E8
    tells you that Edouard Manet was French. If you have new information for an
    existing artist and attribute (e.g. you found out that Salvador Dali was
    French, not Spanish), you would update a cell.
