Introduction
============

People often find it easier to learn visually. Colors and patterns can be easier
to interpret than words and numbers. Have you ever read an article that does not
include some form of picture, or graphic, or map? Visualizations make data easy
to access, make articles easy to read, and make findings easy to interpret.

**A data visualization is any visual representation of data.** Examples include:

-   Tables
-   Line graphs
-   Maps
-   Pie charts
-   Infographics
