============

You have probably heard of statistics. They are everywhere: in news articles,
sports, government reports, just to mention a few. Journalists use data to
substantiate their reporting, political leaders use data to inform their
decisions, sports teams and businesses lean heavily on statistical algorithms

any field of work or study. This chapter explains the basics of statistics, and
