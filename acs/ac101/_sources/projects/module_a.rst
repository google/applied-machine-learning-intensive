Project Description
-------------------

In this project, you will design a survey to answer a research question of your
own, and then share the results. Here are the steps you’ll need to complete.

1.  Form a group of no more than 4 people.

    -   You may want to form a group with people who are in a similar major or
        have similar interests as this may make question selection easier.

2.  Decide on a research question with your group members. Your question should
    ask about the relationship between **two or more** attributes.

    -   Examples of a good research question: Does handedness (left or right)
        have an impact on whether you played a sport in high school? Do people
        who have dogs walk more than people who don’t?
    -   Example of an inadequate question: What percent of people are
        left-handed? (This question involves only one attribute.)

3.  Design a survey with questions to help you answer your research question.
    Remember to create clear questions that elicit specific answers.

4.  Deploy your survey and collect **at least 30** responses.

    -   Having trouble getting enough responses, or want more participants? Try
        social media!

5.  Clean, analyze, and visualize your data. Remember to answer your research
    question, though you may have other insights you’d like to share as well.

    -   To answer your research question, you’ll need to subset the data in some
        way. (For example, compare left-handed people to right-handed people.)
    -   Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, and
        variance) from your data for each subset and compare.

6.  Share your results. Make a slide deck to share with the class that includes
    the following:

    -   What is your research question?
    -   Where did your data come from?
    -   Summarize and visualize your results.
    -   What are possible sources of bias, and how would you improve your study
        next time?

7.  Submit your slides, sheet used for analysis, and a link to your survey by
    **[Due Date]**.

8.  **Optional** (faculty can decide whether to include or not): After
    completing and submitting your project, complete the group work self
    assessment and group assessment.

       the research question.
     - Survey questions not submitted.

   * - **Survey Responses (4)**
     - 30 or more responses were collected.
     - Between 15 and 29 responses were collected.
     - Fewer than 15 responses were collected.
     - No responses were collected.

   * - **Survey Sources (6)**

     - Methods for recruiting participants are not outlined in the slides.

   * - **Comparison of at least two groups (4)**
     - Analysis includes a complete and data-supported comparison of at least
       two groups via filtering or subsetting, including a comparison of centers
       (mean/median) and spread (standard deviation / variance).
     -
     - Analysis includes an incomplete or not data-supported comparison.
     - Analysis does not include a comparison.

   * - **Visualization (6)**

     - Visualization is irrelevant and inaccurate.
     - Slides do not include a visualization.

   * - **Summary of Results (4)**
     - Slides include a summary of results that answers the research question.
     -
     - Slides include a summary of results that is incomplete or unrelated to
       the research question.
     - Slides do not include a summary of results.

   * - **Issues and Next Steps (6)**
     - Slides include a section identifying issues and sources of potential
       bias. Slides include possible steps to improve the study in the future.
     - Slides lack detail in either section, or have missed significant sources
       of bias in their survey.
     - Slides are missing a section identifying issues and sources of potential
       bias. Slides are missing a section on next steps.
     - Slides do not include a section on issues or on next steps.

   * - **Readability (4)**
     - The slides are colorful and easy to read (in terms of font and
       font-size). The slides have very few spelling/grammar errors.
     - Slides are generally easy to read with some small but non-negligible
       exceptions.
