Visualization Checklists
========================

What should I look for when reading a visualization?
----------------------------------------------------

Being able to interpret visualizations is a fundamental skill in data science.
Like any form of media, a visualization has an author. As such, it has potential
biases, and can be interpreted in different ways. Here is a checklist of
important things to consider when reading a visualization.

1.  Who is the **author** of the visualization?

    -   Is the author a single person, or is the author writing on behalf of an
        organization?
    -   Is the author an experienced statistician and/or writer?

2.  How rigorously has the visualization (or the article in which the
    visualization appears) been **reviewed**?

    -   For example, if the visualization appears in *The New York Times* it has
        likely been thoroughly reviewed, whereas if the visualization is part of
        a personal blog it may not have been.

3.  What **data** is backing the visualization?

    -   It is *crucial* to know what data is used to make the visualization. For
        example:

        -   **Location**: Is it global data, or is it a specific
            country/state/region?
        -   **Demographic**: Is it a subset of people, specified by something
            like (but not limited to) race/gender/age?
        -   **Sampling**: Does it include *all* of the people in a given
            population, or just a sample? Is the sample random? How was the
            sample chosen? (For example, if you were conducting a study of
            students at your college, your population of interest would be all
            students at the college, while a sample would be just the students
            in your dorm.)

4.  What **biases** might the author have?

    -   Especially if the visualization is on a media platform, it may have
        unconscious or conscious bias. This may include, but is not limited to:

        -   political bias
        -   racial bias
        -   product bias (i.e. if the author trying to promote/sell something)

5.  What **point** is the author trying to make with the visualization?

    -   A visualization is an author’s choice of medium to convey facts and/or
        opinions.
    -   What are these core facts and/or opinions?

6.  Why has the author chosen this **type** of visualization?

    -   The “type” of visualization indicates the format, e.g. Is it a table? Is
        it a pie chart?
    -   What does this type of visualization do to accentuate their point?

What should I keep in mind when creating a visualization?
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  What **point** do you intend to make with the visualization?

    -   It is important to keep in mind what facts and/or opinions you are
        trying to convey with your visualization.

2.  What is the **content** of the visualization?

    -   What data will you need?
    -   What aspects of the data will you need to showcase?

3.  Who is the **audience** of the visualization?

    -   The audience of your visualization will impact everything in the
        visualization, from the type of graphic to the style of language used.
    -   It is also crucial to know how data-competent your audience is. You want
        everyone who sees this visualization to understand it.

4.  Make the visualization **physically accessible to all**.

    -   `More than 1 billion people have some form of disability.`_
    -   For example: Will a dyslexic person understand your visualization? Will
        a color-blind person understand your visualization?
    -   `This article identifies some key considerations for accessible data
        visualizations.`_

5.  Make the visualization **understandable to all**.

    -   Think about things like language, color, size, and ask: Is this the
        simplest way to express this information?
    -   How simple/complicated should your visualization be, depending on the
        technical understanding of your audience?

6.  Try **different types** of visualization.

    -   The “type” of visualization indicates the format, e.g. Is it a table? Is
        it a pie chart?
    -   How do you know a specific type of visualization is the best unless you
        try others?
