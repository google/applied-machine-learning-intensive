What Is A Statistic?
====================

Many people discuss statistics, but not everyone knows what a statistic actually
is.


.. admonition:: Statistic Definition

   **A statistic is a fact of the data.** A statistic is any piece of
   information you can get from a set of data.


For example, suppose you have a dataset containing the heights of all students
in this class. The following are all statistics from that dataset.

-   The shortest height is \__.
-   The tallest height is \__.
-   There are \__ students in this class.
-   The average height is \__.
-   95% of students have a height less than \__.
-   The sum of all heights in the class is \__.
-   Half the maximum height is \__.

Some statistics are more common and useful than others. For example, knowing the
average height will likely be more useful in real life than knowing than the sum
of all heights. This chapter will guide you through the most common descriptive
statistics.

   Currently the shortanswer directive needs the entire question on one line.
   When fixed, make this question adhere to line limit.
