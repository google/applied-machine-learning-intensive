# Applied Computing 1: Introduction to Google Sheets and SQL

## What is AC1?

The primary goal of AC1 is to teach students data literacy: the ability to
access, transform, use, and interpret data, ethically and effectively, to inform
decision-making. This is a practical, hands-on course that will teach students
to ask and answer questions about data through spreadsheets, SQL databases, and
data visualization tools. The skills and problem solving mindset they learn will
be highly applicable to any major or career.

This is an interdisciplinary course combining concepts from data science,
computer science, and statistics. It is not a comprehensive introductory
course in any of those fields. AC1 prepares students for more comprehensive
courses on Python programming and data science in Python. Students
who do not take more courses on the subject will still have a useful
understanding of widely-used data science tools and techniques, which they can
continue to use and build upon.

## Learning Objectives

Daily learning objectives follow seven overarching themes in achieving data
literacy.

1.  Data Transformation (DT): Understanding and proper usage of basic relational
    algebra operators (e.g. filter, aggregation, join).

1.  Ethics and Fairness (E): Identifying ethical considerations in the
    collection, analysis, and presentation of data (e.g. privacy, fairness,
    disclosure).

1.  Modeling (M): Intuitive understanding of statistical models and variance;
    practical ability to use core modeling techniques (e.g. linear and logistic
    regression).

1.  Problem Solving (PS): Solving large problems by breaking them into smaller
    pieces, anticipating results, and troubleshooting when results are not
    expected.

1.  Programming Readiness (PR): Ability to write and fix problems in formal
    language syntax; understanding of fundamental programming constructs (e.g.
    conditionals, functions).

1.  Storytelling (S): Posing research questions, using the correct data
    analysis, interpreting the results, and presenting the conclusions.

1.  Visualization (V): Choosing, creating, interpreting, and critiquing data
    visualizations.

Students will see these learning objectives in their textbook. To further help
them make and retain connections across different units, you should make an
effort to connect course concepts to these overarching themes whenever possible.
