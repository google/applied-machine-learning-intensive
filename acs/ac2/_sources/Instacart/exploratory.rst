   change by day of the week?
-  What is the distribution of the number of items in the shopping cart
   just before checkout?
-  what is the most popular second item?
-  What department or aisle do users most frequently shop first?
-  What department or aisle do users most frequently shop last?
-  Create a bar chart of the number of itesm sold by day of the week
-  What department gets the most sales?
-  Create a chart that shows the number of items bought from each
   department.
-  Do most people shop linearly? Is there a visualization that would
   show the path that most people take through the store? By Aisle? By
   Department? – using the order placed in shopping basket.
