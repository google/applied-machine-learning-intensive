Random forests are a simple yet powerful machine learning tool based on decision trees. Random
forests are easy to understand, yet they touch upon many advanced machine learning concepts such as
ensemble learning and bagging. These models can be used for both classification and regression.
They also are not sensitive to unscaled data.

In this unit we will learn about random forests and apply them to machine learning problems. We will
touch on ensemble learning techniques and will work with random forest hyperparameters to tune
models.
